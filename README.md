The original RSEI data can be downloaded from https://www.epa.gov/rsei/how-get-risk-screening-environmental-indicators-rsei-model.  The data are stored in access databases.

Point the 01_getData.py python script at the database folder to process data into an sqlite table used by the rest of the tools to process the data into a usable format for toxictrends.org
