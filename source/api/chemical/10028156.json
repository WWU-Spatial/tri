    "Federal Register": "185. Ozone (CAS No. 010028-15-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Information from a large number of studies of both humans and animals indicate that ozone can affect structure, function, metabolism, pulmonary defense against bacterial infection, and extrapulmonary effects. Among these extrapulmonary effects are: (1) Cardiovascular effects; (2) reproductive and teratological effects; (3) central nervous system effects; (4) alterations in red blood cell morphology; (5) enzymatic activity; and (6) cytogenetic effects on circulating lymphocytes. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ozone on EPCRAsection 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nEffects of ozone on green plants include injury to foliage, reductions in growth, losses in yield, alterations in reproductive capacity, and alterations in susceptibility to pests and pathogens. Based on the known interrelationships of different components of ecosystems, such effects, if of sufficient magnitude, may potentially lead to irreversible changes of sweeping nature to ecosystems.\r\n\r\nMeasured aquatic acute toxicity values for ozone include a 96-hour LC sub 50 of 80 ppb for striped bass, a 96-hour LC sub 50 of 30 ppb for channel catfish, and a 96-hour LC sub 50 of 9.3 ppb for rainbow trout. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ozone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available ecotoxicity data for this chemical.",
