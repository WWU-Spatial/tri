    "Federal Register": "164. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (CAS No. 000872-50-4) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). In a 2-generation reproductive study, there was evidence of reproductive toxicity in the F sub 1 generation after exposure to 50 mg/kg/day (LOAEL; no NOAEL was established). Exposure to 50 mg/kg/day or more resulted in significant reductions in the male fertility index and in the female fecundity index. In addition, exposure to 500 mg/kg/day resulted in an increased incidence of dams with decreased corpora lutea. There was also evidence of developmental toxicity in both generations after exposure to 500 mg/kg/day as demonstrated by reduced litter size, reduced postnatal survival, and reduced pup weight.\r\n\r\nMaternal toxicity (significant reduction in mean body weight gain) was observed in rabbits receiving 175 mg/kg by gavage on days 6 through 18 of gestation (The NOAEL was 55 mg/kg/day). Exposure to 540 mg/kg/day (LOAEL) resulted in developmental toxicity as demonstrated by a significant increase in resorptions, and malformations (misshapen skull bone and cardiovascular malformations). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 175 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing N-methylpyrrolidone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental and reproductive toxicity data for this chemical.",
