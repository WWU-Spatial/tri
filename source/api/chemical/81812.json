    "Federal Register": "Chemicals; Toxic Chemical Release Reporting; Community Right-To-Know; Proposed Significant New Use Rule\r\n70. Warfarin and salts (NA). Several studies in humans suggest that warfarin  induces fetal death, and/or structural abnormalities in fetuses and newborns following oral exposure (doses as low as 8.4 mg/kg) or intramuscular injection (12 mg/kg). In mice, warfarin affected female fertility causing preimplantation  mortality following intravenous injection (240 mg/kg). In rabbits, intravenous injection of warfarin (10 mg/kg) to pregnant does resulted in structural abnormalities of fetuses and stillbirth (Refs. 38 and 46). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing warfarin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA  section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available reproductive/developmental toxicity  data for this chemical.",
