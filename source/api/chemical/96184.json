    "Federal Register": "262. 1,2,3-Trichloropropane (CAS No. 000096-18-4) (RCRA APP8) (Ref. 8). Results of a subchronic oral toxicity study in rats and mice reveal that the primary target organs for 1,2,3-trichloropropane are the liver and kidney. Renal and hepatic necrosis were observed in rats administered 1,2,3-trichloropropane by gavage for 17 weeks. The LOAEL was 16 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 8 mg/kg/day for hepatic effects. The LOAEL was 32 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 16 mg/kg/day for renal effects. Hepatic necrosis in mice occurred at 125 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was 63 mg/kg/day. Less severe renal necrotic changes were seen at 250 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was 125 mg/kg/day. The renal and hepatic lesions were accompanied by increases in organ weights and alterations in serum enzymes that were indicative of hepatic and renal toxicity. At lower dose levels (the LOAEL was 16 mg/kg/day), nonregenerative anemia (decreased hematocrit, hemoglobin, and erythrocyte count) was observed in rats. The NOAEL was 8 mg/kg/day. Nonregenerative anemia is considered to be one of the most sensitive effects of 1,2,3-trichloropropane.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory tract is a principal target of inhaled 1,2,3-trichloropropane in humans and animals. Irritation of the eyes and throat has been reported in humans acutely exposed (15 minutes) to 100 ppm (0.602 mg/L) of 1,2,3-trichloropropane via inhalation. Irritative effects on the olfactory epithelium have been observed in rats exposed by inhalation to 3 ppm (the LOAEL was 0.018 mg/L; the NOAEL was 0.006 mg/L) of 1,2,3-trichloropropane for 11 days. Histological effects have also been seen in the nasal cavity (the LOEL was 125 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 63 mg/kg/day) in rats and in the bronchiolar epithelium (the LOEL was 63 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 32 mg/kg/day) in mice that were exposed to 1,2,3-trichloropropane by oral intubation for 17 weeks.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 1,2,3-trichloropropane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hematological, respiratory, hepatic, and renal toxicity data for this chemical.",
