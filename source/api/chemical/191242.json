The predicted aquatic toxicity values for benzo(g,h,i)perylene, based on QSAR analysis using the equation for neutral organics and an estimated log Kow of 6.7, include calculated values of 0.030 milligrams per liter (mg/L) for the fish 96\u2013hour LC50 (i.e., the concentration that is lethal to 50% of test organisms) and 0.0002 mg/L for fish chronic toxicity, 0.012 mg/ L for the daphnid 48-hour LC50 and 0.027 mg/L for the 16\u2013day chronic LC50, and 0.03 mg/L for the algae 96\u2013hour EC50 (i.e., the concentration that is effective in producing a sublethal response in 50% of test organisms) with an algal chronic toxicity of 0.012 mg/L. These predicted aquatic toxicity values indicate that benzo(g,h,i)perylene is toxic at relatively low concentrations and thus is highly toxic to aquatic organisms. EPA believes that the evidence is sufficient to list benzo(g,h,i)perylene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available ecotoxicity information for this chemical.",
