Oral exposure of male rats to 380 mg/kg triphenyltin chloride over 19 days caused adverse effects on the testes, epididymis, sperm duct, prostate gland, seminal vesicle, Cowper's gland, and accessory glands. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triphenyltin chloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the reproductive toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nMeasured aquatic acute toxicity data for triphenyltin chloride include a 48-hour LC sub 50 for carp of 55 ppb and a 72-hour EC sub 50 (growth) for marine green algae of 0.92 ppb. In addition, the measured aquatic toxicity information indicates a freshwater green algae 8-day EC sub 50 (growth) of 2 ppb.
