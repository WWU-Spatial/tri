    "Federal Register": "43. Methacrylonitrile (CAS No. 00126-98-7). In dogs, methacrylonitrile induced convulsions, loss of motor control in the hindlimbs, and histopathological brain lesions following a 90-day inhalation exposure, resulting in a NOAEL of 9 mg/m 3 (3.2 ppm; the adjusted dose (ADJ) is 0.34 mg/kg/day) and a LOAEL of 24 mg/m 3 (8.8 ppm; the ADJ is 0.85 mg/kg/day). No toxic effects occurred in rats when exposed to higher levels than those given to the dogs. In other studies, convulsions have been reported in rats and mice when acute exposures were in excess of 600 ppm methacrylonitrile (Ref. 38). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing methacrylonitrile on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based upon the available neurotoxicity data for this chemical.  ",
