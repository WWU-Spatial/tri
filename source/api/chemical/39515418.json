    "Federal Register": "120. Fenpropathrin (2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl ester) (CAS No. 039515-41-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 1-year feeding study, tremors were noted in dogs exposed to 6.25 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. In a developmental toxicity study in rats, signs of neurotoxicity reported in the pregnant dams included ataxia, tremors, convulsions, lacrimation, prostration of death. The LOEL for maternal toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day and the NOEL was 6 mg/kg/day. In 2-year dietary studies in rats and mice, body tremors and increased mortality were observed in male rats (the LOEL was 30 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 22.5 mg/kg/day), whereas only marginally increased hyperactivity was noted in female mice (the LOEL was 65.2 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 16.2 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fenpropathrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for fenpropathrin include a rainbow trout 96-hour LC sub 50 of 2.3 ppb, a bluegill 96-hour LC sub 50 of 2.2 ppb, a sheepshead minnow 96-hour LC sub 50 of 3.1 ppb, and a daphnid 48-hour EC sub 50 of 0.53 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fenpropathrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
