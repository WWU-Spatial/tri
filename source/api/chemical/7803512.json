    "Federal Register": "199. Phosphine (CAS No. 007803-51-2) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Available data on phosphine indicate that its inhalation LC sub 50 for rats is between 4 and 40 ppm (the exposure time was 4 hours). Phosphine is a highly-toxic gas with a probable oral lethal dose of 5 mg/kg. An air concentration of 3 ppm is safe for long-term exposure, 500 ppm is lethal in 30 minutes, and a concentration of 1,000 ppm is lethal after a few breaths.\r\n\r\nEPA's exposure analysis indicates that phosphine concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing phosphine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
