    "Federal Register": "206. Pirimiphos methyl (O-(2-(diethylamino)-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-O,O-dimethyl phosphorothioate) (CAS No. 029232-93-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Pirimiphos methyl is a cholinesterase inhibitor in humans and other mammalian species. A mild and transient decrease in plasma cholinesterase activity was observed in 2 of 4 female humans given pirimiphos methyl daily in a capsule at dose levels of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 56 days. This effect was not seen in 3 of 3 males. The dose level of 0.25 mg/kg/day was considered a NOEL for plasma cholinesterase inhibition. Based on the NOEL, an oral RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day was derived. The findings of the 56-day study were corroborated by the 28-day feeding study (capsule) with 5 male human volunteers where 1 individual showed borderline cholinesterase depression. Inhibition of brain cholinesterase (LOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day, the NOEL for cholinesterase inhibition was not determined) was observed in a 2-year feeding study in dogs. Inhibition of plasma cholinesterase activity (the LOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day) was seen in a 2-year feeding study in rats. No clinical signs were reported for the above studies. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing pirimiphos methyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical.",
