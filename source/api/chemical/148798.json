    "Federal Register": "246. Thiabendazole (2-(4-Thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole) (CAS No. 000148-79-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Oral administration of 600 mg/kg/day (LOEL) to rats on days 6 through 15 of gestation produced cleft palate and open eyes. Musculoskeletal abnormalities were observed in the offspring of mice orally administered 240 mg/kg on day 9 of gestation. Musculoskeletal abnormalities were also observed in the offspring of rats orally administered 296 mg/kg/day on days 8 through 15 of gestation. Decreased litter size, and skin abnormalities were observed in the offspring of rats orally administered 667 mg/kg/day on days 8 through 15 of gestation. Oral administration of 1,300 mg/kg/day produced musculoskeletal abnormalities and fetal death in the offspring of mice. Oral administration of 2,400 mg/kg/day on day 11 of gestation produced craniofacial abnormalities in the offspring of mice. EPA believes there is sufficient evidence for listing thiabendazole on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for thiabendazole include a rainbow trout 96-hour LC sub 50 of 560 ppb, a daphnid 48-hour EC sub 50 of 0.31 ppb, and a mysid 96-hour LC sub 50 of 340 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing thiabendazole on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.",
