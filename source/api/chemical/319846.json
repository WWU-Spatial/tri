    "Federal Register": "131. alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane (CAS No. 000319-84-6) (CERCLA; CWA PPL; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane is classified by EPA as a Group B2 compound; i.e., the substance is a probable human carcinogen. Although human data are limited, there is a case report of acute leukemia in a Japanese sanitation employee following occupational exposure to alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane and DDT. alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane has been shown in dietary studies to cause an increase in the incidence of liver tumors in five mouse strains and in Wistar rats. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nMeasured aquatic acute toxicity test data for alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane include a 48-hour EC sub 50 of 800 ppb for daphnids. This chemical is expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic systems because the measured bioconcentration factor (BCF) for rainbow trout is 1950. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical and its potential for bioaccumulation.",
