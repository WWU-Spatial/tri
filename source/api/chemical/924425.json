    "Federal Register": "162. N-Methylolacrylamide (CAS No. 000924-42-5) (CAL) (Ref. 8). There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity from N-methylolacrylamide in a 2-year study using B6C3F1 mice administered the substance by oral gavage. In both sexes, there were increased incidences of Harderian gland adenomas or carcinomas, hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas, and alveolar or bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas. There was also an increase in ovarian granulosa cell tumors. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing N-methylolacrylamide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
