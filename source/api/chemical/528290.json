EPA considers this approach appropriate in light of the fact that the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) considers that the toxicologic properties of all isomers should be similar and has set identical standards for them.\r\nMale rats exposed orally to meta-dinitrobenzene in the diet for 16 weeks showed testicular atrophy with indication of loss of function.  EPA believes this information is sufficient to establish that ortho-, meta-, and para-dinitrobenzene are known or can reasonably be anticipated to cause serious reproductive dysfunction in humans.\r\nEPA finds that isosafrole, creosote, and dinitrotoluene (mixed isomers) are known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans.  EPA has also determined that ortho-, meta-, and para-dinitrobenzene are known or can reasonably be anticipated to cause serious reproductive dysfunctions in humans.",
