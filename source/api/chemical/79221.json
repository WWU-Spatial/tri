    "ChemName": "METHYL CHLOROCARBONATE",
    "Federal Register": "44. Methyl chlorocarbonate (CAS No. 00079-22-1). No chronic systemic, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, or reproductive studies could be located in the available literature for methyl chlorocarbonate. A 10-minute exposure to 190 ppm (1 mg/L) by inhalation is reported to be lethal in humans; other conditions  of the exposure were not reported. The 1-hour inhalation LC 50 for rats is 88 ppm (0.5 mg/L) (Ref. 38). Therefore, there may be sufficient evidence for listing methyl chlorocarbonate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity data for this chemical.
