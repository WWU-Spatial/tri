    "Federal Register": "Dinitrobenzenes. The derivation of RQ scores for ortho-, meta-, and para- dinitrobenzene is based on a subchronic study of rneta-dinitrobenzene. EPA considers this approach appropriate in light of the fact that the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) considers that the toxicologic properties of all isomers should be similar and has set identical standards for them. Male rats exposed orally to meta- dinitrobenzene in the diet for 16 weeks showed testicular atrophy with indication of loss of function. EPA believes this information is sufficient to establish that ortho-, meta-, and pare- dinitrobenzene are known or can reasonably be anticipated to cause serious reproductive dysfunctions in humans.",
