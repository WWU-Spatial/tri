    "Federal Register": "216. Propargite (CAS No. 002312-35-8) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). In a developmental toxicity study in which rabbits were exposed via oral gavage to doses greater than or equal to 6 mg/kg/day (fetotoxic LOAEL) of propargite during gestation days 6 to 18, delayed ossification, increased fetal resorption, decreased fetal viability and reductions in fetal body weight were noted. The maternal LOAEL in this study was also 6 mg/kg/day and was based on body weight reductions. The NOEL for maternal and fetal toxicity was 2 mg/kg/day. Developmental effects (increased incidence of missing sternebrae) were also reported in offspring of rats exposed orally during gestation days 6 to 15. The fetotoxicity LOAEL was 25 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 6 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propargite on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nMeasured aquatic acute toxicity data for propargite include a bluegill sunfish LC sub 50 of 31 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propargite on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
