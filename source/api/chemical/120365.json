    "Federal Register": "110. 2,4-DP (dichlorprop) (CAS No. 000120-36-5) (FIFRA SR; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-DP (2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid) is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type herbicide. Developmental toxicity has been reported in rats and mice administered oral doses of 2,4-DP as low as 20 mg/kg during gestation days 4 through 18. Behavioral changes and physical effects were observed in newborn rats, while increased post-implantation loss was observed in the mothers. Exposure of mice to much higher doses (3,000 and 4,000 mg/kg) for shorter durations (i.e., gestation days 6 through 15) caused musculoskeletal abnormalities and fetotoxicity.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-DP on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
