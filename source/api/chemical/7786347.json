Measured aquatic acute toxicity values for mevinphos include a 96-hour LC sub 50 of 70 ppb for bluegills, and a 96-hour LC sub 50 of 0.16 ppb for daphnids. Measured acute avian toxicity data include a pheasant oral LD sub 50 of 1.37 mg/kg, a mallard duck oral LD sub 50 of 4.63 mg/kg, and a sharp-tailed grouse oral LD sub 50 of 1.34 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing mevinphos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
