    "Federal Register": "89. Dimethylamine (CAS No. 000124-40-3) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). Dimethylamine is corrosive to the mucous membranes, respiratory tract and eyes of treated animals. B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats exposed to 10 to 175 ppm (0.018 to 0.32 mg/L) dimethylamine via inhalation for 6 to 12 months developed dose-related lesions in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium. Significant decreases in body weight occurred in high-dose (175 ppm; 0.32 mg/L) animals of both species, and some of the high-dose mice died following exposure.\r\n\r\nCentrilobular fatty degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells were reported in mice, rats, rabbits or guinea pigs administered 97 or 183 ppm (0.18 or 0.34 mg/L) dimethylamine via inhalation for 18 to 20 weeks. Increased liver weight without any histopathological changes were reported following 8-month oral exposure of rats to 0.35 mg/kg/day and guinea pigs exposed to 3.5 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nRats administered oral doses of dimethylamine as low as 0.035 mg/kg for 8 months exhibited changes in conditional reflexes including marked attenuation of the excitation process and speedier extinction of the positive reflex.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dimethylamine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic respiratory, hepatic, and neurological toxicity of this chemical.",
