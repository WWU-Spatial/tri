    "Federal Register": "28. Brucine (CAS No. 000357-57-3) (CERCLA; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Brucine is an alkaloid similar in structure to strychnine. It is capable of causing death or permanent injury due to exposures in normal use. In humans, brucine can cause central and peripheral paralysis, convulsions, and respiratory failure. A potentially lethal oral dose in small children is 5 to 10 mg. The lethal oral dose for an adult may be as low as 30 mg. The acute oral LD sub 50 in rabbits is 4 mg/kg.\r\n\r\nEPA's exposure analysis indicates that brucine concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing brucine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
