    "Federal Register": "134. Hexazinone (CAS No. 051235-04-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 2-year mouse feeding study, liver hypertrophy, hyperplastic nodules and focal necrosis were observed at 375 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. In a 90-day feeding study in dogs, decreased body weight, increased alkaline phosphatase activity, decreased albumin/globulin ratio and increased absolute and relative liver weights were noted in both sexes at 5,000 ppm (125 mg/kg/day; LOEL). The NOEL was 1,000 ppm (25 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing hexazinone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nMeasured aquatic acute toxicity test data for hexazinone include an EC sub 50 of 7 ppb for S. capricornutum. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing hexazinone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
