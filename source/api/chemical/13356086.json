    "Federal Register": "117. Fenbutatin oxide (hexakis(2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl)distannoxane) (CAS No. 013356-08-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a rat teratology study, the LOEL for developmental toxicity (toxic to zygote) was 60 mg/kg/day and the NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. In a rabbit teratology study, oral administration of 5 mg/kg/day produced intrauterine lethality and was also toxic to maternal animals. The NOEL was 1 mg/kg/day. In a 3-generation rat reproduction study, administration of 15 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced decreased viability index. The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fenbutatin oxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for fenbutatin oxide include a rainbow trout 96-hour LC sub 50 of 1.7 ppb, a fathead minnow 96-hour LC sub 50 of 1.9 ppb, a daphnid 48-hour EC sub 50 of 3.1 ppb, a bluegill sunfish 96-hour of LC sub 50 of 4.8 ppb, and a sheepshead minnow 96-hour LC sub 50 of 20.8 ppb. Avian acute toxicity values include a quail oral LD sub 50 of 0.007 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fenbutatin oxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
