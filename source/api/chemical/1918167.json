No evidence of maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits administered propachlor by gavage at 0, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 19 of gestation. Statistically significant increases in mean resorptions/postimplantation loss with corresponding decreases in the mean number of viable fetuses were reported at 15 and 50 mg/kg/day when compared to controls. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propachlor on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data.",
