    "Federal Register": "6. Benzo(rst)pentaphene (CAS No. 00189-55-9). Benzo(rst)pentaphene is classified as a Group B2 carcinogen by EPA; i.e., the compound is a probable human carcinogen based on the lack of human data and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. It is classified as a Group 2B carcinogen by IARC; i.e., possibly carcinogenic to humans. Carcinomas of the skin were observed in mice following dermal exposure to the chemical. Pulmonary and hepatic tumors were noted in mice receiving intraperitoneal injections of the chemical (Ref. 37). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing benzo(rst)pentaphene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available  carcinogenicity data for this chemical.
