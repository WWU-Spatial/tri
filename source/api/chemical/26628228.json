    "Federal Register": "224. Sodium azide (CAS No. 026628-22-8) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Although not used clinically, sodium azide is a direct acting vasodilator. A reduction in blood pressure was noted in hypertensive patients orally exposed to sodium azide during an investigation of the substance in treating cancer. Reductions in blood pressure were also reported in animals following acute exposure. The minimal hypotensive dose in humans has been estimated to be approximately 0.2 to 0.4 mu g/kg (0.0002 to 0.0004 mg/kg). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium azide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the ability of this substance to lower blood pressure.",
