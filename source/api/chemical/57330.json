    "ChemName": "PENTOBARBITAL SODIUM",
    "Federal Register": "189. Pentobarbital sodium (CAS No. 000057-33-0) (CAL) (Ref. 8). Pentobarbital sodium is commonly used as a sedative hypnotic. The average adult sedative dose is 20 to 40 mg orally. The average adult hypnotic dose is 100 to 200 mg orally. Pentobarbital is also used parenterally or rectally to provide basal hypnosis for general, spinal, or regional anesthesia. Like other barbiturates, a common adverse effect to using pentobarbital sodium is central nervous system depression. Chronic exposure to pentobarbital sodium may lead to psychological and physical dependence.\r\n\r\nIntraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg on day 1 of pregnancy produced adverse effects on fertility in rats. Intraperitoneal injections of 80 mg/kg to rats on day 1 of pregnancy caused preimplantation loss. Intraperitoneal injection of 94.5 mg/kg on day 2 of pregnancy decreased fertility and caused fetal death in rats. Intraperitoneal injection of 22 mg/kg on day 10 of pregnancy caused adverse effects in rat fetuses (details of study not reported). Subcutaneous injection of 520 mg/kg of pentobarbital sodium on days 9 to 21, or administration of 30 mg/kg on day 19 of pregnancy produced abnormal behavioral effects in rat offspring. Exposure to pentobarbital sodium during pregnancy can cause fetal addiction to the substance.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing pentobarbital sodium on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental, reproductive, and chronic neurological toxicity data for this chemical.",
