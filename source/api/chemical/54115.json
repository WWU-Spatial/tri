    "Federal Register": "174. Nicotine and salts (CAL: CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA AT; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8).  Nicotine salts will dissociate in aqueuous solutions to yield soluble nicotine.  Nicotine is highly toxic to humans.  The estimated lethal oral dose in adults is approximately 40 to 60 mg.  The onset of toxicity if rapid.  Symptoms include nausea, salivation, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, weakness, sweating, and confusion.  Nicotine markedly stimulates the central nervous system, causing tremors and convulsions.  The stimulation is followed by depression, and death resulting from paralysis of respiratory muscles.  Nicotine can also activate parasympathetic ganglia and cholinergic nerve endings resulting in gastrointestinal hyperactivity.\r\n\r\nSkeletal defects and occasional cleft palates were observed in mice injected with 25 mg/kg nicotine on gestation days 9 to 11.  Reduced size in the newborns of rats and limb deformities in the offspring of swine were reported in swine and rats following oral exposure to 1,058 ppm nicotine (approximately 53 mg/kg/day).  deformities were found in some rabbit fetuses when dams were administered nicotine at a dose of 20 mg/kg 5 times during pregnancy.  Pregnant swine fed aqueous leaf extracts of tobacco at the rate of 16 and 32 mg/kg nicotine produced arthrogrypotic newborn pigs.\r\n\r\nEPA believes there is sufficient evidence for listing nicotine and its salts as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for these substances.",
