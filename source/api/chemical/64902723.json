    "Federal Register": "52. Chlorsulfuron (2-chloro-N-[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]carbonyl] benzenesulfonamide) (CAS No. 064902-72-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a rabbit developmental study, an increased incidence of fetal resorptions was observed at the LOEL of 75 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nIn a 3-generation rat reproduction study, a decrease in fertility index was observed at 125 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chlorsulfuron on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental and reproductive toxicity data for this chemical.",
