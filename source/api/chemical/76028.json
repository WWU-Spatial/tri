    "Federal Register": "259. Trichloroacetyl chloride (CAS No. 000076-02-8) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Trichloroacetyl chloride is highly toxic in humans by the oral and inhalation routes of exposure. Numerous cases of strong irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and fever, nausea, and vomiting following exposure to trichloroacetyl chloride have been reported. The acute inhalation LC sub 50 values for mice and rats are 0.445 mg/L and 0.475 mg/L, respectively, indicating that trichloroacetyl chloride is highly toxic by inhalation in these species. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that trichloroacetyl chloride concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing trichloroacetyl chloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
