    "Federal Register": "153. Metham sodium (sodium methyldithiocarbamate) (CAS No. 000137-42-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Postimplanatation loss was observed in rabbits administered metham sodium at 30 mg/kg/day (LOEL) on days 6 to 18 of gestation. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day (4.2 mg/kg/day based on active ingredient). In rats fed metham sodium, increased variations, retardations, and anomalies were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day (LOEL) administered on days 6 to 15. The NOEL was less than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (less than or equal to 4.2 mg/kg/day based on active ingredient). Although neither study was considered to be fully adequate due to study design and reporting deficiencies, the weight of evidence indicates that metham sodium induces developmental toxicity. In addition, metham sodium is metabolized to carbon disulfide, a potent developmental toxicant. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing metham sodium on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical and its metabolite, carbon disulfide.",
