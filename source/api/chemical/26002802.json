    "Federal Register": "193. Phenothrin (2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-1-propenyl) cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl ester) (CAS No. 026002-80-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Hepatocellular enlargement and increased absolute and relative liver weights were observed in a chronic feeding study in dogs. The LOEL was 27.7 mg/kg/day in males and 26.8 mg/kg/day in females. The NOEL was 8.2 mg/kg/day in males and 7.1 mg/kg/day in females. Hepatocellular hypertrophy and increased relative liver weight (the LOEL was 150 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 50 mg/kg/day) were observed in a chronic oncogenicity study in rats. Increased liver weight (the LOEL was 150 mg/kg/day, the NOEL was 45 mg/kg/day) was noted in another chronic oncogenicity feeding study in mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing phenothrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for phenothrin include a rainbow trout 96-hour LC sub 50 of 16.7 ppb and a goldfish 48-hour LC sub 50 of 100 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing phenothrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
