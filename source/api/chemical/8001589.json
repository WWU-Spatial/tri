    "Federal Register": "A weight of evidence determination classifies creosote as a Group B1 carcinogen under the EPA Proposed Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment.  There is sufficient animal evidence and limited human evidence to determine that creosote is known of can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans.\r\nCarcinogenicity of creosote:  AWPI contends that the IARC and NTP reviews on creosote are incomplete because they do not include unpublished studies.  The unpublished studies are referred to by AWPI as three epidemiological studies which show that exposure to creosote in the wood treating industry does not adversely affect human health.  \r\nWith regard to the cancer criterion under section 313, EPA must conclude that a chemical causes or can cause cancer in humans in order to include that chemical on the section 313 lists.  As with IARC and NTP, EPA can only consider data which are available when assessing the potential toxicity of any chemical.  While there may be unpublished epidemiological studies on creosote which AWPI claims show no adverse human health effects, there are still data to indicate that there is limited human evidence, and sufficient animal evidence to reasonably anticipate that creosote causes cancer in humans.  IARC and NTP have concluded that creosote is a possible human carcinogen.",
