    "Federal Register": "222. Sethoxydim (2-[1-(ethoxyimino)butyl]-5-[2(ethylthio)propyl]-3-hydroxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one) (CAS No. 074051-80-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Mild anemia (the LOEL was 17.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 8.9 mg/kg/day) was observed in male dogs fed sethoxydim for 1-year. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.09 mg/kg/day. Swollen liver cells (the LOEL was 117 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 45 mg/kg/day) were seen in mice fed sethoxydim for 14 weeks. Pathological effects in the liver (the LOEL was 45 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day) were noted in rats fed sethoxydim for 14 weeks. Nonneoplastic liver lesions (the LOEL was 54 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 18 mg/kg/day) were observed in mice fed sethoxydim for 2 years. Decreased phenosulfophthalein (PSP) clearance (the NOEL was greater than 3 mg/kg/day; the LOEL not determined) was noted in dogs given sethoxydim in the diet for 26 weeks. Decreased PSP clearance (the LOEL was 20 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day) was also noted in a 6-month feeding study in dogs. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sethoxydim on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological, hepatic, and renal toxicity data.",
