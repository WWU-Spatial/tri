    "Federal Register": "263. Triclopyr triethylammonium salt (CAS No. 057213-69-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Degeneration of proximal tubules (the LOEL was 20 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day) was noted in male and female rats fed triclopyr for 3 months. A LOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day, based on phenosulfophthalein (PSP) excretion, was reported in dogs fed triclopyr for 6 months. A similar effect was also noted at the LOEL of 5 mg/kg/day, determined in dogs fed triclopyr for 8 months. The NOEL was greater than 5 mg/kg/day. Significant increases in absolute and relative kidney weights were observed in rats fed 36 mg/kg/day for 2 years. The NOEL was 12 mg/kg/day. In a pharmacokinetic study, reduced PSP excretion was seen in dogs administered 5 mg/kg/day, whereas no effect on PSP excretion was seen in monkeys administered 20 mg/kg/day. No details on the route and length of exposure were provided. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triclopyr triethylammonium salt on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available renal toxicity data.",
