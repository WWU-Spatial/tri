In a 1-year dog feeding study, a NOEL of greater than 5 mg/kg/day was established due to abnormal behavior, ataxia, convulsions, and neurological effects in the brain and spinal cord at 100 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing pebulate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data.",
