    "Federal Register": "241. Temephos (CAS No. 003383-96-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Temephos is a cholinesterase inhibitor in many mammalian species. The LOELs at which the cholinesterase inhibition was observed ranged from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg/day. However, human subjects that ingested 256 mg/day for 5 days or 64 mg/day for 4 weeks showed no clinical signs or effects on plasma or red blood cell cholinesterase activities. Dietary exposure of rats to 350 mg/kg/day for 90 days resulted in cholinesterase inhibition only; no clinical signs were reported. Rabbits and guinea pigs tolerated 10 mg/kg/day for extended periods without clinical effects, and dogs tolerated 3 to 4 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing temephos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data.",
