    "Federal Register": "102. Dipropyl isocinchomeronate (CAS No. 000136-45-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Dipropyl isocinchomeronate has been classified by EPA as a Group B2 compound, i.e., a probable human carcinogen. This classification is based on the findings of multiple malignant and benign tumors in the rat (liver adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes, kidney carcinomas in both sexes, benign testes tumors in males and uterine tumors in females), and multiple malignant tumors in the mouse (liver adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes and lung/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas in males). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dipropyl isocinchomeronate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity toxicity data.",
