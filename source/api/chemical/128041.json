    "Federal Register": "227. Sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate (CAS No. 000128-04-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). By analogy to potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate, sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate can reasonably be anticipated to cause fetotoxicity, postimplantation loss and malformations. Data on potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate follows. New Zealand white rabbits given 38 mg/kg/day by gavage on days 6 to 18 of gestation exhibited malalignment of sternebrae, total postimplantation loss, and fetal weight decrement. Also at this dose level, various possible malformations including adactyly, gastroschisis, short tail, anal atresia, spina bifida, atelectasis, costal cartilage anomaly, vertebral anomaly with/without rib, caudal vertebrae anomaly, and severe sternebrae malalignment in 6 of 52 fetuses from 5 of 11 litters. At the 77 mg/kg/day dose level, there was severe fetal/embryo lethality. The NOEL was 12.8 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for the analogue potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate.",
