    "Federal Register": "78. Dichlorophene (2,2'-methylenebis(4-chlorophenol) (CAS No. 000097-23-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Increased incidence of microphthalmia was observed in the offspring of rats administered 25 mg/kg/day (teratogenic LOEL). The NOEL was 5.0 mg/kg/day. A dose of 75 mg/kg/day (fetotoxic LOEL) produced delayed ossification of vertebral centra and sternaebrae, reduced body weight and length, and increased resorptions in rat fetuses. The fetotoxic NOEL was 5.0 mg/kg/day. No other developmental studies were available. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dichlorophene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for dichlorophene include a measured 48-hour LC sub 50 of 50 ppb for Spicodioptomus (calanoid copipod). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dichlorophene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.",
