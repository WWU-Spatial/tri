    "Federal Register": "32. C.I. Direct Blue 218 (CAS No. 028407-37-6) (NTP) (Ref. 8). In an NTP bioassay, there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of C.I. Direct Blue 218 in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on significantly increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. In a 2-year NTP feeding study in rats, there was some evidence of carcinogenicity in male F344 rats based on a significant increase in the incidence of squamous cell papillomas of the pharynx in the high dose group (500 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing C.I. Direct Blue 218 on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
