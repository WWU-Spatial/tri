    "ChemName": "TRIALLATE",
    "Federal Register": "254. Triallate (CAS No. 002303-17-5) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Triallate, a dithiocarbamate insecticide, is a cholinesterase inhibitor. When triallate was administered to rats at a dose of 147.1 mg/kg/day orally and to cats at a dose of 0.028 mg/L/day (via aerosol) for 2 months, the animals developed fatal morphological changes in neurons of the cerebral cortex, subcortical area, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Doses of 30 mg/kg/day caused head bobbing and circling in pregnant rats. The NOEL was 7.5 mg/kg/day. The LOEL and NOEL for liver effects in a 2-year study in dogs fed diets containing triallate were 4.25 mg/kg/day and 1.28 mg/kg/day, respectively. At 4.25 mg/kg/day an increase in hemosiderin deposition and serum alkaline phosphatase was observed in both sexes, and an increase in liver weight was observed in females. Based on the NOEL, an oral RfD of 0.013 mg/kg/day was derived. In a hamster chronic feeding study, decreased triglycerides were seen in males at the LOEL of 30 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. Ninety-day feeding studies in rats (10 mg/kg/day) and dogs (5 mg/kg/day) showed no treatment related adverse effects except for increased liver-to-body-weight ratios in the dogs. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triallate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurological and hepatic toxicity data for this chemical.",
