    "Federal Register": "103. Disodium cyanodithioimidocarbonate (CAS No. 000138-93-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Rats administered disodium cyanodithioimidocarbonate by gavage on gestation days 6 to 15 demonstrated increased skeletal variations in offspring. The NOEL is 6 mg/kg, and the LOEL is 18 mg/kg. In a rabbit teratology study, increased resorptions were observed in rabbits administered the compound by gavage on gestation days 6 to 18. The NOEL is 3 mg/kg, and the LOEL is 10 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing disodium cyanodithioimidocarbonate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data.",
