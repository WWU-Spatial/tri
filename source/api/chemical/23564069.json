    "Federal Register": "250. Thiophanate ethyl ([1,2-phenylenebis (iminocarbonothioyl)] biscarbamic acid diethyl ester) (CAS No. 023564-06-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 6-month dog study, dietary administration of 500 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced thyroid changes. The NOEL was 50 mg/kg/day. Thyroid follicular hypertrophy was observed at 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL) in a rat 2-year dietary study. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing thiophanate ethyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available thyroid toxicity data for this chemical.",
