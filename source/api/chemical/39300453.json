    "Federal Register": "97. Dinocap (CAS No. 039300-45-3) (CAL; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Dinocap is a dinitrophenyl-type fungicide. In mice, oral administration of 25 mg/kg/day of dinocap on days 7 to 16 of gestation has been shown to increase post-implantation mortality and reduce newborn viability. Oral administration of 5.0 mg/kg/day to pregnant mice produced developmental toxicity in the offspring (administration of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in abnormalities of the musculoskeletal and hepatobiliary system in the offspring). In the same study, oral administration of 20 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 16 of gestation produced craniofacial abnormalities in offspring. In the same study, behavioral abnormalities and delayed growth were observed in offspring of mice receiving 12 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 16 of gestation. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dinocap on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nMeasured aquatic acute toxicity data for dinocap indicate that the LC sub 50 for rainbow trout is 15 ppb and the LC sub 50 for bluegill is 20 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dinocap on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
