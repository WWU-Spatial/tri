    "Federal Register": "178. p-Nitroaniline (CAS No. 000100-01-6) (CERCLA; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). In a 14-day study in mice fed p-nitroaniline in doses as low as 10 mg/kg, 5 days per week, methemoglobin concentrations were found to be significantly higher than those in control animals. In the same study, hematocrit values in mice that received 300 mg/kg, and total erythrocyte counts in mice that received 100 or 300 mg/kg, were significantly lower than those of control animals. Similar effects were observed in 13-week and 2-year mouse studies. In the 2-year study, lesions related to the administration of p-nitroaniline occurred in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow (primarily in mice receiving 30 or 100 mg/kg) and were observed at 9 and 15 months. In addition, increases in the incidence or severity of splenic congestion, hematopoiesis, pigment (hemosiderin) accumulation, Kupffer cell pigmentation in the liver, and bone marrow hypercellularity (hyperplasia). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing p-nitroaniline on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity data for this chemical.",
