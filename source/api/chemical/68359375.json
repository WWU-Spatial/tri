    "Federal Register": "58. Cyfluthrin (3-(2,2-Dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid, cyano(4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl ester) (CAS No. 068359-37-5) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 14-day rat study, oral administration of 60 mg/kg/day produced tremors, uncoordinated gait, salivation, slight brain hemorrhages, necrosis of the skeletal muscle fibers, and death. The NOEL was not defined. In another study, salivation, straddled gait, axonal degeneration of sciatic nerve, microtubular dilation, and mitochondria degeneration in the sciatic and femoral nerves were observed in rats administered 80 mg/kg/day orally for 5 days and 40 mg/kg/day for the following 9 days. No NOEL was established.\r\n\r\nLiver and adrenal weight increases were observed in rats orally administered 40 to 80 mg/kg/day for 28 days. The highest dose of 80 mg/kg/day was reduced to 40 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. Liver weight changes and urobilinogen and ketone bodies in the urine were observed in rats fed 15 mg/kg/day for 28 days. No NOEL was established. In a 28-day mouse feeding study, increased liver weight was observed at 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day.Inflammatory foci in the kidneys of females were observed at 7.5 mg/kg/day in a 2-year rat feeding study. The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL of the study, an oral RfD of 0.025 mg/kg/day was determined. Increased alkaline phosphatase activity was observed in males at 7.5 mg/kg/day in a 23-month mouse feeding study.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing cyfluthrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological, hepatic, and renal toxicity data.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for cyfluthrin include a rainbow trout 96-hour LC sub 50 of 0.68 ppb, a bluegill 96-hour LC sub 50 of 1.5 ppb, and a daphnid 48-hour EC sub 50 of 0.14 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing cyfluthrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.",
