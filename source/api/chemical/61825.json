    "Federal Register": "2. Amitrole (CAS No. 00061-82-5). Amitrole is classified as a B2 carcinogen by EPA; i.e., a probable human carcinogen. It is classified as a Group 2B carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC); i.e., the  compound is a possible human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals and inadequate evidence in humans. Animal studies indicate that amitrole administered in the diet to rats or mice induced thyroid  carcinomas (rats) and thyroid adenomas (mice) (Ref. 37). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing amitrole on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
