Decrease in heart weight, obliterative vasculitis, and perivasculitis of the hepatic blood vessels were observed in dogs orally administered 1-(3-chloroallyl)-3,5,7-triaza-1-azoniaadamantane for 90 days. The NOEL was 7.5 mg/kg/day; the LOEL was 15 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 1-(3-chloroallyl)-3,5,7-triaza-1-azoniaadamantane chloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for 1-(3-chloroallyl)-3,5,7-triaza-1-azoniaadamantane.",
