    "Federal Register": "83. Diflubenzuron (CAS No. 035367-38-5) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). In a 2-year study in which beagle dogs received diflubenzuron daily in gelatin capsules, the LOAEL for increases in sulfhemoglobin and methemoglobin was 10 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 2 mg/kg/day. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.02 mg/kg/day for this chemical from this study. Similar effects were noted in two separate 2-year rat feeding studies (the LOAEL was 7.8 to 8 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 2 mg/kg/day), and in a lifetime oral study in mice (the LOAEL was 12 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 2.4 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diflubenzuron on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological toxicity data.\r\n\r\nMeasured aquatic acute toxicity data for diflubenzuron include a 48-hour LC sub 50 of 4.55 ppb for daphnids. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diflubenzuron on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
