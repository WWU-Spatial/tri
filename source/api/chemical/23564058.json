    "Federal Register": "251. Thiophanate-methyl (CAS No. 023564-05-8) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Decreased spermatogenesis was observed in male rats fed 32 mg/kg/day thiophanate-methyl. The NOEL was 8 mg/kg/day. Other effects noted at the 32 mg/kg/day dose level included decreased body weight and histological evidence of hyperthyroidism.\r\n\r\nIn a 3-generation reproductive study in rats, reduced litter weights were seen at a daily dietary dose of 32 mg/kg thiophanate-methyl. The NOEL was 8 mg/kg/day. A decrease in the number of implantations was observed in mice administered a limit dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing thiophanate-methyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the reproductive toxicity data for this chemical.",
