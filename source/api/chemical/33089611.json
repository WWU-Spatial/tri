    "Federal Register": "10. Amitraz (CAS No. 033089-61-1) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Amitraz is an aniline-type insecticide. In a 2-year beagle dog feeding study, effects noted at the LOAEL dose (1.0 mg/kg/day) at various times during the study included significantly increased mean blood glucose concentration, slight hypothermia, and slight central nervous system depression (the latter effect occurred immediately after dosing on days 1 and 2). The NOAEL in this study was 0.25 mg/kg/day and the oral RfD derived from the NOAEL was 0.0025 mg/kg/day. These findings were supported by similar results obtained in a 90-day feeding study in dogs. In studies with rats or mice exposed to amitraz from 90 days to 2 years, LOAELs less than or equal to 12 mg/kg/day were derived based on effects that included decreased body weight gain and changes in organ (brain or heart) weight (the NOELs were less than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day).\r\n\r\nA three-generation reproduction study in rats demonstrated decreased litter size and increased mortality during suckling. The fetotoxic LOAEL in this study was 5 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 1.6 mg/kg/day. In a teratology study in rabbits, a fetotoxicity LOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day and NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day were based on the incidences of cleft palate and meningocoele associated with small ears and displaced toes.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing amitraz on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity and developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
