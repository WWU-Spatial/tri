    "Federal Register": "17. Bifenthrin (CAS No. 082657-04-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Tremors or head and forelimb twitching were noted in dogs, rats and rabbits exposed to various doses. NOEL values based on the appearance of tremors (often transient) ranged from 1 to 2.67 mg/kg/day. The oral RfD for bifenthrin was based on a 1year beagle dog feeding study, in which the LOEL, based on tremors observed during weeks 15 to 29, was 3.0 mg/kg/day and the NOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day. The RfD based on this NOEL was 0.015 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nIn a rat teratology study, an increased incidence of hydroureter (without hydronephrosis) was noted in fetuses at 2 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 1 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bifenthrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological and developmental toxicity data.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for bifenthrin include a bluegill 96-hour LC sub 50 of 0.35 ppb, a rainbow trout 96-hour LC sub 50 of 0.15 ppb, a sheepshead minnow LC sub 50 of 17.5 ppb, and a daphnid 48-hour EC sub 50 of 1.6 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bifenthrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.",
