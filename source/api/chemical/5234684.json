    "Federal Register": "37. Carboxin (5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-N-phenyl-1,4-oxathiin-3-carboxamide) (CAS No. 005234-68-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Decreased body weight gain and food consumption, increased mortality, and reduced kidney, heart and spleen weights were observed in rats fed 600 ppm (30 mg/kg/day) carboxin for 2 years. The NOEL is 200 ppm (10 mg/kg/day). A similar NOEL was established in a three-generation rat reproduction study. Based on the NOEL, EPA established an oral RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day. In a 90-day feeding study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys was seen at 600 ppm (30 mg/kg/day). The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing carboxin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available renal toxicity data for this chemical.",
