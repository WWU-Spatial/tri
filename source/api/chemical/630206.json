    "ChemName": "1,1,1,2-TETRACHLOROETHANE",
    "Federal Register": "63. 1,1,1,2-Tetrachloroethane (CAS No. 00630-20-6). 1,1,1,2-Tetrachloroethane is classified as a Group C carcinogen by EPA; i.e., the compound is a possible human carcinogen based on an increased incidence of combined hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice following oral exposure. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded at the high dose. There is inadequate evidence from human studies. The compound is classified as a Group 3 chemical by IARC; i.e., it is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. The study conducted by NTP was inadequate for evaluating carcinogenicity (Refs. 38 and 46). Therefore, there may be sufficient evidence for listing 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical.  \r\nOral exposure to 250 mg/kg/day of 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane caused inactivity and incoordination in rats. No NOAEL was established. CNS involvement (sluggishness, incoordination, and weakness) also was seen in mice exposed to 500 mg/kg/day of 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane via the oral route; the NOAEL was 250 mg/kg/day (Ref. 38). Therefore, there may be sufficient evidence for listing 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurotoxicity data for this chemical.
