    "Federal Register": "68. 2,4-D 2-ethylhexyl ester (CAS No. 001928-43-4) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D 2-ethylhexyl ester is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type herbicide. The 2-ethylhexyl moiety contains eight carbons and, therefore, is an isooctyl group. Developmental toxicity following maternal exposure to 2,4-D isooctyl esters has been demonstrated in the rat and mouse. Fetotoxicity occurred in offspring of rats exposed to 528 mg/kg during gestation days 8 through 11. Rats orally exposed to doses as low as 302 mg/kg during gestation days 9 through 12 had musculoskeletal abnormalities. Exposure to a lower dose (188 mg/kg) for a longer period during gestation (days 6 through 15) caused developmental effects on homeostasis and effects on newborn growth statistics. In mice, 438 mg/kg administered orally during gestation days 8 to 12 also caused effects on newborn growth statistics.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D 2-ethylhexyl ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for 2,4-D isooctyl esters, and on the toxic effects of its metabolite 2,4-D.\r\n\r\nThe aquatic acute toxicity data for 2,4-D isooctyl esters include a measured 48-hour LC sub 50 of 8.8 ppm for bluegill. In addition, 2,4-D isooctyl esters are expected to bioaccumulate based on the estimated log K sub ow of 6.6. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D 2-ethylhexyl ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data and the potential for bioaccumulation.",
