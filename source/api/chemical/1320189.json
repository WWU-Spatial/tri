    "Federal Register": "111. 2,4-D propylene glycol butyl ether ester (CAS No. 001320-18-9) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D propylene glycol butyl ether ester is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type herbicide. In mammals, the propylene glycol butyl ether ester is expected to hydrolyze to yield the free acid, 2,4-D. Therefore, the toxicity of 2,4-D propylene glycol butyl ether ester is expected to be similar to that of 2,4-D, in which the kidney, liver, and nervous system are the primary targets of injury. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D propylene glycol butyl ether ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity data for this chemical.",
