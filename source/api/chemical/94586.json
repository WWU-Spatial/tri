    "Federal Register": "26. Dihydrosafrole (CAS No. 00094-58-6). Dihydrosafrole is classified as a Group 2B carcinogen by IARC; i.e., the compound is a probable human carcinogen based on the lack of data in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. Chronic oral administration of dihydrosafrole induced liver tumors in mice and esophageal tumors in rats (Ref. 37). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing dihydrosafrole on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to  EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data.  ",
