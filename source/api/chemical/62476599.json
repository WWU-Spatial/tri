    "Federal Register": "3. Acifluorfen sodium salt (5-(2-chloro-4-(triflouromethyl)phenoxy)-2-nitro-benzoic acid, sodium salt) (CAS No. 062476-59-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Acifluorfen is classified as a Group B2 compound, i.e., the chemical is a probable human carcinogen. Acifluorfen produced an increased incidence of combined malignant and benign liver tumors in two different strains of mice. The compound also displayed positive mutagenic activity in several non-mammalian test systems, and is structurally similar to four other diphenyl ether herbicide compounds which caused increased incidences of liver tumors in two different strains of mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing acifluorfen sodium salt on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data.",
