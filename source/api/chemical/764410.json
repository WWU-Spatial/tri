    "Federal Register": "22. 1,4-Dichloro-2-butene (CAS No. 00764-41-0). 1,4-Dichloro-2-butene is classified as a Group B2 carcinogen by EPA; i.e., the compound is a potential human carcinogen based on an increased incidence of nasal carcinomas in male and female rats in two inhalation studies. It is classified as a Group 3 carcinogen  by IARC; i.e., not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. 1,4-Dichloro-2-butene induced germ cell mutation and was mutagenic in in vivo and in vitro assays (Ref. 37). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing 1,4-dichloro-2-butene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based upon the available carcinogenicity and mutagenicity data for  this chemical.
