    "Federal Register": "156. Methoxone ((4-Chloro-2-methylphenoxy) acetic acid) (MCPA) (CAS No. 000094-74-6) (FIFRA SR; IARC) (Ref. 8). Methoxone is a chlorophenoxy-type herbicide. Animal studies indicate that the kidney and liver are the primary target organs of methoxone toxicity. Beagle dogs fed diets containing methoxone for 1-year developed liver toxicity, which was demonstrated by increased liver weights associated with alterations in serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, bilirubin, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. These effects occurred at doses of 0.75 mg/kg/day (LOAEL) and higher. The NOAEL was 0.15 mg/kg/day. Kidney changes in the treated animals included deposition of kidney pigment in the proximal tubular epithelium (the LOAEL was 0.75 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 0.15 mg/kg/day), and was accompanied by alterations in creatinine, urea, and potassium levels. EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.0005 mg/kg/day from this study. Similar changes suggesting liver and kidney toxicity were reported in another 90-day dog feeding study (the LOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/day) and in rats in a 90-day feeding study (the LOAEL was 7.5 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day).\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing methoxone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and renal toxicity data for this chemical.",
