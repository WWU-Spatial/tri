    "Federal Register": "2. Acephate (acetylphosphoramidothioic acid O,S-dimethyl ester) (CAS No. 030560-19-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 28-month feeding study in rats, inhibition of brain, plasma, and red blood cell cholinesterase activities was observed at 50 parts per million (ppm) (2.5 mg/kg/day). The NOEL for this study was 5 ppm (0.25 mg/kg/day). Similar findings were noted in a 2-year feeding study in dogs. The LOEL for this study was 100 ppm (2.5 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was 30 ppm (0.75 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing acephate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurotoxicity data for this chemical.",
