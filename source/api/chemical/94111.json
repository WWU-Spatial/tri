    "Federal Register": "104. 2,4-D isopropyl ester (CAS No. 000094-11-1) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI: IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D isopropyl ester is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type herbicide. In mammals, the isopropyl ester of 2,4-D is hydrolyzed to yield the free acid, 2,4-D. Therefore, the toxicity of 2,4-D isopropyl ester is expected to be similar to that of 2,4-D, in which the kidney, liver, and nervous system are the primary targets of injury. 2,4-D is presently included in the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D isopropyl ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the known toxic effects of its metabolite 2,4-D.",
