Increased liver weights and alkaline phosphatase activity and hepatic lesions (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs fed pendimethalin for 2 years. EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.04 mg/kg/day. Hypertrophy of the liver and increased liver weights were observed in rats fed 5,000 ppm (250 mg/kg/day) for 3 months. The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing pendimethalin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data.",
