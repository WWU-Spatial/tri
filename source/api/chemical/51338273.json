    "Federal Register": "80. Diclofop methyl (2-[4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) phenoxy]propanoic acid, methyl ester) (CAS No. 051338-27-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a rat teratology study, increased resorptions, reduced body weights, and dilation of the renal pelvis or distension of the ureter in offspring were reported in rats fed 1.6 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. Increased pup mortality was observed at 5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) in a 3-generation rat reproduction study. The NOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nIn a 30-day rat feeding study, increased relative heart, liver, and kidney weights were observed at the LOEL of 4 mg/kg/day. No NOEL was established. Jaundice, increased bilirubin, increased serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, and increased liver and kidney weights were observed in a 30-day dog feeding study at 50 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day. In a 90-day rat feeding study, elevated liver weights and centrilobular enlargement of hepatic cells were observed at 4 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 1.6 mg/kg/day. Dogs fed 6.25 mg/kg/day for 90 days had increased lipid content and focal changes in the renal cortex. The NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diclofop methyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental, hepatic, and renal toxicity data.",
