    "Federal Register": "242. Terbacil (5-chloro-3-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-methyl- 2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione) (CAS No. 005902-51-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Decreases in the number of implantations and live fetuses, were observed in rats administered 62.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) orally for days 6 to 15. The NOEL was 12.5mg/kg/day. Significantly reduced body weights were observed in the offspring of rabbits orally administered 600 mg/kg/day (LOEL) orally on days 6 to 18 of gestation. The NOEL was 200 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nIn a 2-week rat dietary study, administration of 1,000 mg/kg/day produced increased absolute and relative liver weights. In a 3-month rat dietary study, administration of 25 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced increased liver weights and vacuolization and hypertophy of hepatocytes. The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. In a 1-year dog study, dietary administration of 48 mg/kg/day to males and 12 (LOEL) and 48 mg/kg/day to females produced increased alkaline phosphatase and alanine transaminase levels. The NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day. In a 2-year dog study, dietary administration of 6.25 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced slight increases in liver weights, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and increased thyroid-to-body-weight ratios. The NOEL was 1.25 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, an oral RfD of 0.013 mg/kg/day was established. Hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes was observed in male mice administered 162.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) in the diet. The NOEL was 6.5 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing terbacil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
