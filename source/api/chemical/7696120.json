    "Federal Register": "244. Tetramethrin (2,2-Dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-1-propenyl) cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (1,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydro-1,3-dioxo-2-H-isoindol-2-yl)methyl ester (CAS No. 007696-12-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Depression, salivation, ataxia, lethargy, and convulsions were observed in acute rat studies in which the oral LD sub 50 values were greater than or equal to 4,400 mg/kg. Tremors, excitement, and increased urine volume were observed in an acute dermal rat study in which the LD sub 50 was greater than 2,500 mg/kg. Tremors, ataxia, dyspnea, gastrointestinal hypermotility, and diarrhea were observed in rats and mice administered tetramethrin subcutaneously or intraperitonealy. The LD sub 50 was greater than 500 mg/kg. In a 6-month dog dietary study, administration of 62.5 mg/kg/day produced nervouseness and tremors. The NOEL was 31.25 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing tetramethrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for tetramethrin include a bluegill 96-hour LC sub 50 of 21 ppb (mixed isomers, technical product) and 69 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing tetramethrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
