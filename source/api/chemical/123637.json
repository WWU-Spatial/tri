    "Federal Register": "55. Paraldehyde (CAS No. 00123-63-7). In humans, paraldehyde induces coma, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, sciatic nerve injury, and CNS depression. Chronic exposure may produce hallucinations; delusions; memory, intellect, and speech impairment; unsteady gait, tremors, anorexia, and weight loss. Nerve injury resulted from intramuscular exposure; other routes of exposure were not reported. Exposure levels were not reported for these effects. Convulsions occurred in a man following intramuscular exposure to 568 mg/kg paraldehyde (Refs. 37 and 46). Because the dose levels were not indicated in case studies, the lowest level for the CNS effects in humans could not be determined. Therefore, the available evidence may be sufficient for listing paraldehyde on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurotoxicity data.  ",
