    "Federal Register": "64. 2,4-D butoxyethyl ester (CAS No. 001929-73-3) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D butoxyethyl ester is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type herbicide. In mammals, the butoxyethyl ester of 2,4-D is hydrolyzed to yield the free acid, 2,4-D. Therefore, the toxicity of 2,4-D butoxyethyl ester is expected to be similar to that of 2,4-D, in which the kidney, liver, and nervous system are the primary targets of injury. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D butoxyethyl ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the known chronic effects of its metabolite 2,4-D.",
