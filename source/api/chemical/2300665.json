    "Federal Register": "90. Dimethylamine dicamba (CAS No. 002300-66-5) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a pilot rabbit developmental toxicity study, an increase in early and late fetal resorptions was observed in animals receiving the LOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day (oral doses, days 6 to 18 of gestation). In another study, increased post-implantation loss was observed in rabbits receiving the LOEL of 10 mg/kg/day (oral doses, days 6 to 18 of gestation). Developmental toxicity was also observed at doses of 10 mg/kg/day in studies with dicamba. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dimethylamine dicamba on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
