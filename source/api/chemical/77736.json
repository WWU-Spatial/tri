    "Federal Register": "81. Dicyclopentadiene (CAS No. 000077-73-6) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). Convulsions were reported in rats or mice following inhalation of dicyclopentadiene at dosage levels of 332 or 145 ppm (1.8 or 0.78 mg/L), respectively, for 1 or 2 days. The reported acute oral LD sub 50 in rats is 353 mg/kg. Animals at this dose level had convulsions and muscle weakness. In a 90-day inhalation study in dogs, neurotoxic symptoms observed included diarrhea, excessive salivation and lack of control of hind quarters. The NOAEL in this study was 8.9 ppm (0.048 mg/L); no LOEL was reported. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dicyclopentadiene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical.",
