The available toxicity data is on dazomet. Rats fed 80 ppm for 2 years (4 mg/kg/day) showed focal necrosis and fatty metamorphosis of the liver. Rats fed 30.3 mg/kg/day experienced decreased weight gain and changes in liver weight. Renal focal tubular necrosis was seen in rats fed 10 ppm (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dazomet sodium on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available renal toxicity data for its free acid, dazomet.",
