    "Federal Register": "Cobalt and compounds. Cobalt was found to be the cause of severe lesions in cardiac muscle and of causing hypothyroidism and thyroid hyperplasia in excessive drinkers of beer to which cobalt sulfate had been added as a foam stabilizer at a level of 1 ppm. The myocardiopathy was associated with episodes of acute heart failure that was frequently fatal. Similar myocardiopathies were demonstrated in rabbits given cobalt chloride; these and other data provide convincing evidence that cobalt was the causative agent, although alcohol may have served to potentiate the effect of cobalt at these low concentrations. In addition to the thyroid effects observed in the above individuals, hypothyroidism and thyroid hyperplasia have been reported in patients treated with cobalt chloride for anemia. It is postulated that soluble cobaltous ion markedly interferes with the update of iodine. Epidemiologic studies suggest that the incidence of goiter (enlarged thyroid) is higher in regions containing increased levels of cobalt in water and soil.",
