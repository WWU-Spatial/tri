    "Federal Register": "9. Ametryn (N-Ethyl-N'-(1-methylethyl)-6-(methylthio)1,3,5,-triazine- 2,4-diamine) (CAS No. 000834-12-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Fatty degeneration of the liver was observed in rats administered 100 mg/kg/day ametryn by gavage, 6 days per week for 13 weeks. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day (8.6 mg/kg/day adjusted for duration). In another study, hepatic effects (severe vascular congestion, centrilobular liver necrosis and fatty degeneration of individual liver cells) were observed in rats that died following gavage administration of 500 mg/kg/day ametryn for 6 days per week for 28 days. The NOEL was 250 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ametryn on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatotoxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nThe 72-hour EC sub 50 for green algae is 14 ppb. Ametryn is a herbicide and may be expected to affect nontarget plants such as algae. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ametryn on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
