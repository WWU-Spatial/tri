    "Federal Register": "14. Benfluralin (N-butyl-N-ethyl-2,6-dinitro-4(trifluoromethyl) benzenamine) (CAS No. 001861-40-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Increased relative liver weights, decreased red blood cell counts and decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin levels were observed in dogs orally administered benfluralin at a dose of 125 mg/kg/day for 2 years. The NOAEL was 25 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOAEL, EPA has established an oral RfD of 0.003 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing benfluralin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological toxicity data for this chemical.",
