    "Federal Register": "1. Acetophenone (CAS No. 00098-86-2). Changes in the ratio of chronaxies of antagonist muscles, decreases in the albumin/globulin ratio of the blood, congestion of the cardiac vessels, and pronounced dystrophy of the liver was observed in male rats continuously exposed to acetophenone vapor at 0.07 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3 ) for 70 days. A lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) and a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 0.0446 milligram per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) and 0.00446 mg/kg/day were determined, respectively. A supporting study reported degeneration of olfactory bulb cells in rats continuously exposed to acetophenone vapor at 9 mg/m 3 (5.7 mg/kg/day) for up to 3 months (Ref. 40).  Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing acetophenone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to section 313(d)(2(B) based on the available toxicity data for this chemical.  ",
