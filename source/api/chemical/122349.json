    "Federal Register": "223. Simazine (CAS No. 000122-34-9) (FIFRA SR; SDWA) (Ref. 8). Simazine is a triazine-type herbicide. Chronic exposure of sheep to low doses (approximately 1.4 to 6 mg/kg/day) of simazine caused fatty and granular degeneration in the liver, and increased SGOT and alkaline phosphatase. Neuronophagia, diffuse kidney degeneration, diffuse glial proliferation and degeneration of ganglion cells in the cerebrum and medulla were also reported in these animals. Dogs that received 1,500 ppm (37.5 mg/kg/day) simazine in a 2-year feeding study also had slight increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and SGOT, indicative of liver damage.\r\n\r\nSheep that received 1.4 mg/kg/day simazine for 37 to 111 days had necrotic changes in the germinal epithelium of the testis and disturbances in spermatogenesis.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing simazine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatic, renal, neurological, and reproductive toxicity of this chemical.",
