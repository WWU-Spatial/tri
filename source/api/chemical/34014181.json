    "Federal Register": "239. Tebuthiuron (N-[5-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)- N,N'-dimethylurea) (CAS No. 034014-18-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Administration of 25 mg/kg/day (LOEL) on days 6 through 18 of gestation produced reduced body weights in offspring of rabbits. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. In a 3-month rat study, dietary administration of 125 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced growth suppression and pancreatic lesions. The NOEL was 50 mg/kg/day. In a 2-generation rat reproduction study, depressed body weight gain was observed in the female parental generation at 14 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 7 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL of the study, an oral RfD of 0.07 mg/kg/day was derived. In a 3-generation rat reproduction study, decreased body weight was observed in the offspring of animals administered 20 mg/kg/day (LOEL). No NOEL was established. Dietary administration of 40 mg/kg/day to rats for 2 years produced growth suppression. The NOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing tebuthiuron on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
