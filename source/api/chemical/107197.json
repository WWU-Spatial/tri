    "Federal Register": "217. Propargyl alcohol (CAS No. 000107-19-7) (CERCLA; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Histopathological changes in the liver and kidney were reported in a subchronic rat feeding study following exposure to propargyl alcohol in the diet for as little as 4 weeks. The liver changes included increased organ weight, hepatocytic megalocytosis with proliferation of bile ducts and cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes, as well as hematological and serum enzyme changes indicative of liver damage. The kidney weights were increased in females only, and both sexes had karyomegaly of the renal tubular epithelial cells. The LOAEL for these changes was 15 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day. EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day from this study. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propargyl alcohol on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity data for this chemical.",
