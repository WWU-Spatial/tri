In a 3-month mouse feeding study, liver weights were increased in males at levels greater than or equal to 620 ppm (80.6 mg/kg/day) and in females at levels greater than 1,100 ppm (143 mg/kg/day). At higher doses (143 to 260 mg/kg/day), decreased total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, and/or periportal fatty liver changes were observed. Mice exposed to dietary levels of 78 mg/kg/day for 1-year had increased liver weight and slight fatty changes. One year feeding studies in Wistar rats also resulted in increased liver weights (the LOEL was 17.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 6.5 mg/kg/day). In a 2-year feeding study with Wistar rats, fatty changes in the liver were observed at 17.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 6.5 mg/kg/day. A 2-year feeding study in mice resulted in fatty liver changes. The LOEL was 78 mg/kg/day and the NOEL was 22.1 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fenarimol on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data.",
