    "Federal Register": "45. 3-Chloro-2-methyl-1-propene (CAS No. 000563-47-3) (NTP) (Ref. 8). In an NTP gavage bioassay there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity from 3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene in rats and mice. The substance induced adrenal cortex, testicular and gastrointestinal tumors in rats and adrenal cortex and gastrointestinal tumors in mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
