    "Federal Register": "215. Propanil (N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)propanamide) (CAS No. 000709-98-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Results of several subchronic and chronic toxicity studies indicated the liver and spleen as the target organs for propanil. Increased relative spleen weight (the LOEL was 20 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day) was noted in female rats fed propanil for 2 years. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.005 mg/kg/day. Histopathological changes (the LOEL was 30 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day) in the liver and spleen were observed in mice orally administered propanil for 90 days. At higher dose levels (i.e., 240 and 1,920 mg/kg/day) cyanosis, methemoglobinemia, and increased liver and spleen weight were noted. In a 90-day rat study, increased spleen weight (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 16.5 mg/kg/day) was seen in females. Decreased hemoglobin levels was seen in males. Increased SGOT and SAP activities (the LOEL was 100 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs orally administered propanil for 2 years. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propanil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data.",
