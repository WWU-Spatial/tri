    "Federal Register": "231. Sodium pentachlorophenate (CAS No. 000131-52-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Pentachlorophenol has been classified by EPA as a Group B2 compound, i.e., a probable human carcinogen. This was based on occurrence of increased combined incidence of hemangiosarcomas, liver tumors, and pheochromocytomas in female mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium pentachlorophenate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for its parent compound, pentachlorophenol.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for sodium pentachlorophenate include a rainbow trout 96-hour LC sub 50 of 55 ppb, a bluegill 96-hour LC sub 50 of 44 ppb, a fathead minnow 96-hour LC sub 50 of 20 ppb, and a shrimp 96-hour LC sub 50 of 84 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium pentachlorophenate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
