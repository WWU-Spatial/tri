    "Federal Register": "172. Nabam (CAS No. 000142-59-6) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Nabam is an ethylene bisthiocarbamate fungicide. Evidence suggests that ethylene bisthiocarbamate fungicides and ethylenethiourea (a common contaminant, metabolite, and degradation product of these fungicides) cause cancer and adverse developmental effects in experimental animals. In a 2-year diet study ethylenethiourea caused liver adenomas and carcinomas in mice, and thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in mice and rats. A NOAEL of less than or equal to 5 mg/kg has been reported for ethylenethiourea, based on a rat developmental toxicity study. Ethylenethiourea caused delayed ossification or hardening of the parietal bone in pups. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nabam on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity and developmental toxicity data for ethylenethiourea, a metabolite and degradation product of nabam.",
