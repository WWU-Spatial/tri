    "Federal Register": "100. Diphenylamine (CAS No. 000122-39-4) (RCRA APP8) (Ref. 8). Increased liver and kidney weights were noted in dogs that received 25 mg/kg/day (the LOAEL) of diphenylamine in their feed for 2 years. The NOAEL in this study was 2.5 mg/kg/day and the oral RfD was 0.025 mg/kg/day. Pronounced anemia and decreased body weight gain were also noted in these animals. The hepatotoxicity induced by diphenylamine is manifested by peripherolobular fat changes and increased lipids. Vacuolar degeneration and hepatocyte necrosis were reported in rats or guinea pigs that received 2 or 4 percent (i.e., 1,000 or 2,000 mg/kg/day for rats and 800 to 1,600 mg/kg/day for guinea pigs) of diphenylamine in the diet for 6 months. In another 2-year rat study, changes reported in the kidney in diphenylamine-fed animals included epithelial necrosis in the proximal tubule, cystic dilatation of tubules, and interstitial inflammation.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diphenylamine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic hepatic and renal toxicity data for this chemical.",
