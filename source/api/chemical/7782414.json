    "ChemName": "FLUORINE",
    "Federal Register": "126. Fluorine (CAS No. 007782-41-4) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Inhalation of fluorine causes initial coughing, choking and chills, which is followed 1 or 2 days later with pulmonary edema. Fluorine has a strong caustic action on mucous membranes, eyes and skin. In human volunteers exposed to 100 ppm (0.16 mg/L) for 30 seconds, much irritation to the nose and eyes was reported. In acute inhalation studies in animals, lethality occurs at a fairly uniform level and is the result of pulmonary edema. Following 1 hour exposures in mice, rats or guinea pigs, the inhalation LC sub 50 values ranged from 150 to 185 ppm (0.23 to 0.29 mg/L). The LC sub 50 for rabbits following a 30-minute exposure was 270 ppm (0.42 mg/L). EPA's exposure analysis indicates that fluorine concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fluorine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
