    "Federal Register": "30. Ethylidene dichloride (CAS No. 00075-34-3). Ethylidene dichloride is classified as a Group C carcinogen by EPA; i.e., the compound is a possible human carcinogen based on the lack of human data and limited evidence of carcinogenicity in two animal species (rats and mice) as shown by an increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas and hemangiosarcomas in female rats and an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and benign uterine polyps in mice in NCI bioassay. Because of similarities in structure and target  organs, the carcinogenicity evidence for 1,2-dichloroethane is considered to support the classification of ethylidene dichloride as a possible human carcinogen (Refs. 5 and 38). Therefore, there may be sufficient evidence for including ethylidene dichloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical.
