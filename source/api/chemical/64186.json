    "ChemName": "FORMIC ACID",
    "Federal Register": "33. Formic acid (CAS No. 00064-18-6). The oral LD 50 values for rats and mice are 1,210 mg/kg and 1,100 mg/kg, respectively. No chronic systemic, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, or reproductive studies could be located in the available literature for formic acid. The principal hazard of formic acid is that of severe damage to the skin, eyes, or mucosal surfaces due to the chemical's corrosive properties. In humans, swallowing formic acid has caused a  number of cases of severe poisoning and death with symptoms such as salivation,  vomiting, burning sensation in the mouth, diarrhea, and pain (Ref. 38). Therefore, there may be sufficient evidence for listing formic acid on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute  toxicity data for this chemical.",
