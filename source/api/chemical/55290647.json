    "Federal Register": "85. Dimethipin (2,3,-Dihydro-5,6-dimethyl-1,4-dithiin 1,1,4,4-tetraoxide) (CAS No. 055290-64-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 1-year dog feeding study, decreased erythrocyte, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels as well as increased platelet levels were observed at 75 mg/kg/day. The LOEL for systemic toxicity based on decreased body weight was 7.5 mg/kg/day. No NOEL could be established. In a 2-year rat feeding study, increased absolute and relative liver weights were observed at 10 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL in the study, EPA established an oral RfD of 0.02 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dimethipin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological and hepatic toxicity data.",
