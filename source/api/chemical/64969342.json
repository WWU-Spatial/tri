    "Federal Register": "75. 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine sulfate (CAS No. 064969-34-2) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). IARC has classified 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (o-dichlorobenzidine) as a group 2B compound, i.e. this chemical is possibly carcinogenic in humans. The sulfate salt of 3,3'dichlorobenzidine is expected to be equally as toxic as the free base (3,3'-dichlorobenzidine). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine sulfate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on its potential to cause cancer in humans.",
