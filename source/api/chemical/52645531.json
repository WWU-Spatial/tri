    "ChemName": "PERMETHRIN",
    "Federal Register": "191. Permethrin (3-(2,2-Dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid, (3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl ester) (CAS No. 052645-53-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Increased liver weights (the LOEL was 500 ppm or 25 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 100 ppm or 5 mg/kg/day) were observed in rats fed permethrin for 2 years. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.05 mg/kg/day. Decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, hepatocellular swelling, and increased liver weight (the LOEL was 100 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs orally administered (in capsules) permethrin for 1-year. Tremors, excessive salivation, convulsions, and incoordination were noted at 1,000 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing permethrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for permethrin include a fathead minnow 96-hour LC sub 50 of 3.5 ppb, a rainbow trout 96-hour measured LC sub 50 of 0.62 ppb, a bluegill 96-hour LC sub 50 of 2.52 ppb, an Atlantic silverside 96-hour measured LC sub 50 2.2 ppb, and a daphnid 48-hour LC sub 50 of 0.32 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing permethrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.",
