    "Federal Register": "84. Diglycidyl resorcinol ether (CAS No. 000101-90-6) (IARC; NTP) (Ref. 8). Diglycidyl resorcinol ether is classified by IARC as a Group 2B compound, i.e., it is possibly carcinogenic in humans. In an NTP bioassay, rats orally administered 12 mg/kg of diglycidyl resorcinol ether 5 days a week for 103 weeks developed squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the stomach. Mice orally administered 50 mg/kg 5 days a week for 103 weeks developed squamous cell carcinomas and squamous cell papillomas of the stomach. Mice orally administered 70.5 mg/kg/day of diglycidyl resorcinol ether for 2 years developed blood lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease. Mice receiving dermal applications of diglycidyl resorcinol ether for 1-year developed skin tumors. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diglycidyl resorcinol ether on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
