    "Federal Register": " 4. 2,3-Dichloropropene. The RQ derivation for this chemical is based on studies using 1,3-dichloropropene. RQ scores for 1,3-dichloropropene are viewed by EPA to be protective for all dichloropropenes. In a subchronic inhalation study, rats exposed to 3 parts per million of 1,3- dichloropropene for 4 hours per day, 5 days per week for 6 months, exhibited slight cloudy swelling of the renal tubular epithelium. Based on the above data, EPA has determined there is sufficient information to establish that the 2,3-dichloropropene is known to cause or can reasonably be expected to cause serious chronic effects in humans.",
