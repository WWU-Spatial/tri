    "Federal Register": "21. Bromacil (5-bromo-6-methyl-3-(1-methylpropyl)-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione) (CAS No. 000314-40-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Increased thyroid activity was seen in male and female rats fed 5,000 ppm (250 mg/kg/day) bromacil for 90 days. In a 2-year dietary study, thyroid hyperplasia was seen in female rats fed 1,250 ppm (62.5 mg/kg/day). Thyroid follicular adenoma was observed in one female. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bromacil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available thyroid toxicity data for this chemical.",
