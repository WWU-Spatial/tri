    "Federal Register": "73. Dichloran (2,6-Dichloro-4-nitroaniline) (CAS No. 000099-30-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Dichloran, an aniline, is a potential inducer of methemoglobinemia. Either single or repeated oral doses of dichloran produced enlarged livers and induction of microsomal enzymes in the rat. Dogs fed 21 mg/kg/day had increases in serum transaminases. In Rhesus monkeys, where dichloran does not induce hepatic enzymes, 160 mg/kg/day for 3 months caused hepatic centrilobular fatty infiltration and death. Inhalation exposure to 0.17 mg/L produced elevated cholesterol levels and increased liver weight in a 3-month rabbit study and increased liver weight in a 21-day rat study. In a 2-year mouse study, dietary administration of 102.7 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced centrilobular hepatocyte enlargement, focal necrosis, acute inflammatory cell infiltration, vacuolization of centrilobular hepatocytes, increased weight of the liver and increased incidence of erythropoiesis in males. The NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dichloran on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data.",
