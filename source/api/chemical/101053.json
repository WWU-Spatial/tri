    "Federal Register": "11. Anilazine (4,6-dichloro-N-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine) (CAS No. 000101-05-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). When anilazine was administered to rats, maternal reproductive parameters were not affected. The systemic maternal NOEL was 150 mg/kg and the LOEL was 500 mg/kg, based on decreased body weight gain. The developmental NOEL was 1,500 mg/kg, which was the highest dose tested. In rabbits, the maternal toxicity NOEL was 15 mg/kg and the LOEL was 40 mg/kg, based on increased mortalities and decreased body weight gain (also decreased percentage of pregnant does at 75 mg/kg). The developmental NOEL was 40 mg/kg and the LOEL was 75 mg/kg, based on increased fetal mortality, decreased fetal weight, and increased postimplantation loss and inhibited ossification (phalanges). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing anilazine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for anilazine include a scud (Gammarus) 96-hour LC sub 50 of 0.27 ppb and an oyster 96-hour EC sub 50 (growth) of 46 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing anilazine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.",
