    "Federal Register": "180. Norflurazon (4-Chloro-5-(methylamino)-2-[3(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3(2H)-pyridazinone) (CAS No. 027314-13-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Congestion of the liver, hepatocyte swelling and increased liver weights, and increase in colloid vacuole in the thyroid were observed in dogs fed 450 ppm (10.25 mg/kg/day) norflurazon for 6 months. The NOEL was 150 ppm (3.75 mg/kg/day). An oral RfD of 0.04 mg/kg/day has been determined. Increased relative liver weight and hypertrophy of the thyroid with depletion of colloid were seen in rats fed 2,500 ppm (125 mg/kg/day) norflurazon for 90 days. The NOEL was 500 ppm (25 mg/kg/day). Hepatic hyperplasia and hypertrophy and increased relative liver weight were noted in a 28-day feeding study in rats. The LOEL was 1,000 ppm (50 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was 500 ppm (25 mg/kg/day). Increased relative liver weight and diffuse and smooth granular livers were seen in a 28-day feeding study in mice. The LOEL was 2,520 ppm (328 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was 420 ppm (55 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing norflurazon on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and thyroid toxicity data.",
