    "Federal Register": "167. Metribuzin (CAS No. 021087-64-5) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a rabbit teratology study, the NOEL for maternal and fetotoxicity was 15 mg/kg/day, and the LOEL was 45 mg/kg/day. Developmental effects including irregular spinus process and decreased pup body weight were observed in rats treated with metribuzin (Sencor) during gestation day 7 to 19 at 85 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL for developmental toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day. The LOEL and NOEL for maternal toxicity were 30 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn a 2-year dog feeding study, adverse effects observed at 1,500 ppm (37.5 mg/kg/day; LOEL) included weight reduction, increased mortality, hematologic changes, and liver/kidney damage. The systemic NOEL was 100 ppm (2.5 mg/kg/day). In a 2-year rat feeding study, decreased weight gain, mortality, and pathological changes in the liver and kidney were observed at 300 ppm (15 mg/kg/day). The NOEL was 100 ppm (5 mg/kg/day).\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing metribuzin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic, renal, and developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
