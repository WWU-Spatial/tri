    "Federal Register": "213. Prometryn (N,N'-bis(1-methylethyl)-6-methylthio-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) (CAS No. 007287-19-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Degenerative changes in the liver and kidney, and bone marrow atrophy (the LOEL was 37.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 3.75 mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs fed prometryn for 2 years. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.004 mg/kg/day. Fatty liver degeneration (the LOEL was 500 mg/kg; the NOEL was 250 mg/kg) was observed in rats fed prometryn for 28 days.\r\n\r\nIn a teratology study in rabbits, test material was administered by gavage from gestation day 7 to 19. Increased abortions and late resorptions occurred at 72 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 12 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing prometryn on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic, renal, bone marrow, and developmental toxicity data.",
