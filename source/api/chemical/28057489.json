    "Federal Register": "6. d-trans-Allethrin [d-trans-Chrysanthemic acid of dallethrone] (CAS No. 028057-48-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Centrilobular hydropic degeneration of the liver (LOEL was 1,000 ppm or 25 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 200 ppm or 5 mg/kg/day) was seen in dogs fed allethrin for 3 months. Increases in serum liver enzymes in female rats and increased liver weights in male and female rats (the LOEL was 250 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 1,500 ppm or 75 mg/kg/day) were observed in rats fed allethrin for 3 months. Histopathology data were not presented in this study. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate hepatotoxic potential for d-trans-allethrin. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing d-trans-allethrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data.",
