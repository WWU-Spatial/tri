    "Federal Register": "145. Lactofen (5-(2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)-2-nitro-2-ethoxy-1-methyl-2-oxoethyl ester) (CAS No. 077501-63-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Lactofen meets the criteria of an EPA Group B2 compound, i.e., a probable human carcinogen. This conclusion was based on an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in males and combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes of CD-1 mice following dietary administration of lactofen. In CD rats, there was increased incidence of liver neoplastic nodules in both sexes. Four structurally similar chemicals, acifluorfen, nitrofen, oxyfluorfen, and fomesafen, all produced hepatocellular tumors in rodents.\r\n\r\nResults of several subchronic and chronic studies indicated the liver and kidney as target organs for lactofen. Increased absolute and relative liver weight and hepatocytomegaly (the LOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was not determined) were observed in male mice fed lactofen for 78 weeks. At 37.5 mg/kg/day, there was also an increased incidence of cataracts and renal pigmentation. Based on the LOEL, an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day was derived. Renal dysfunction and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and red blood cell counts (the LOEL was 25/75 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day) were observed in a 1-year feeding study in dogs. Increased renal and hepatic pigmentation (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day) were noted in a 2-year feeding study in rats. In a 90-day mouse study, increased alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), and serum gleutanic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) activities, increased liver weight, hepatic necrosis, biliary hyperplasia, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin levels and red blood cell counts, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and kidney nephrosis and fibrosis (the LOEL was 26 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was not determined) were seen. Decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, decreased red blood cell counts, and brown pigment in the kidney and liver (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day) were noted in a 90-day feeding study in rats.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing lactofen on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data and hepatic, renal, and hematological toxicity data for this chemical.",
