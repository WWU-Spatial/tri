    "Federal Register": "137. Imazalil (1-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(2-propenyloxy)ethyl]-1H-imidazole) (CAS No. 035554-44-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a rat teratology study, increased maternal mortality, decreased litter size, and increased number of dead fetuses were observed in animals administered 40 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. Stillbirths and altered live birth index were observed in rats orally administered 80 mg/kg/day days 16 through 22 of gestation and 21 days post gestation. Altered lactation index was observed in rats orally administered 20 mg/kg/day on days 16 through 22 of gestation and 21 days post gestation. Post-implantation loss was observed in rabbits orally administered 0.63 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 18 of gestation. Altered viability index was observed in rabbits orally administered 2.5 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 18 of gestation. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing imazalil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
