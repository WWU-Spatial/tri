    "Federal Register": "55. Cyanazine (CAS No. 021725-46-2) (CAL; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Cyanazine is a triazine-type herbicide. In a three-generation reproduction study in Long-Evans rats, F sub 3b female weanlings had increased relative brain weights and decreased relative kidney weights. The LOAEL was 4.05 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 1.35 mg/kg/day. In rabbits that received cyanazine in gelatin capsules during gestation days 6 to 18, there was increased postimplantation loss, decreased litter size, and alterations in ossification. In addition, there were increased malformations in the offspring, including anophthalmia/microphthalmia, dilated brain ventricles, dome cranium and thoracoschisis (the LOAEL was 2 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/day). Similar developmental effects were reported in Fischer 344 rats administered cyanazine during gestation days 6 to 15 (the LOAEL was 25 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL 5 was mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing cyanazine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
