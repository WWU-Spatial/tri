    "Federal Register": "38. Chinomethionat (6-methyl-1,3-dithiolo[4,5-b]quinoxalin-2-one) (CAS No. 002439-01-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Increases in liver weight, liver protein, and both total liver and microsomal RNA levels, as well as inhibition of mixed-function oxidase enzymes (e.g., N-demethylase, cytochrome P-450) were noted in rats administered 75 mg/kg/day by oral gavage for 4 days or in female rats administered 75 mg/kg/day in their diet for 21 days. Liver enlargement was reported in rats fed 10 mg/kg/day in their diet for 35 days. The increase in liver size was attributed to increased cellular protein and an increase in water content. Rats exposed orally to 2,700 mg/kg for 90 days (30 mg/kg/day) had changes in liver weight and effects on the hepatic microsomal oxidases as well as weight loss or decreased body weight gain. In a 1-year dog study, the NOEL was established at 0.6 mg/kg/day for the test material in the diet. The LOEL was 1.9 mg/kg/day as indicated by extra medullary hematopoietic nodules in the liver.\r\n\r\nIn a developmental toxicity study in rats, increased resorption and decreased fetal weight were reported at 37.5 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested). The NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day. In another developmental study in rats given 30 mg/kg/day in carboxy methyl cellulose by gavage from gestation day 6 to 20, cleft palate, anasarca and micrognathia was observed.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chinomethionat on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and developmental toxicity data.",
