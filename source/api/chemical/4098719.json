    "Federal Register": "144. Isophorone diisocyanate (CAS No. 004098-71-9) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). The 4-hour inhalation LC sub 50 value of isophorone diisocyanate in rats is 0.123 mg/L. The rat and mouse 3-hour inhalation RD sub 50 (50 percent reduction in respiratory rate) values are 0.0046 mg/L and 0.0019 mg/L, respectively. A 50-year old man developed severe asthma after exposure to an unspecified amount of paint containing isophorone diisocyanate. A 1-hour exposure to an unspecified amount of the compound caused eczema in three out of four workers. In addition, isocyanates as a class are generally severe skin, eye and respiratory irritants. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that isophorone diisocyanate concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isophorone diisocyanate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nAs detailed in Unit IV.B.132. of this preamble, as an alternative proposal to the individual listing of HDI, isophorone diisocyanate, and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), EPA is proposing to create a diisocyanates category that includes HDI, isophorone diisocyanate, 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), and 16 other diisocyanates.",
