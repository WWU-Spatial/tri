    "ChemName": "HEXACHLOROPHENE",
    "Federal Register": "35. Hexachlorophene (CAS No. 00070-30-4). Dogs fed hexachlorophene at 0.75, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg/day in the diet for 13 weeks had status spongiosis in the brain, optic nerve, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve at all dose levels tested. A NOAEL was not established. In a 16-week dietary study, cerebral edema and vacuolization in the white matter in the CNS were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (Ref.  46). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing hexachlorophene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available  neurotoxicity data for this chemical.  \r\n\r\nAquatic toxicity test data for hexachlorophene show that the measured 96-hour LC 50 for the fathead minnow is 21 ppb whereas the estimated fish 96-hour LC 50  , based on QSAR analysis using the equation for phenols and a log P of 7.78, is  20 ppb. Measured terrestrial toxicity data for wildlife indicate that the oral LD 50 for bobwhite quail is 575 mg/kg (ppm) and the oral LD 50 for female mallard ducks is 1,450 mg/kg (ppm) (Refs. 3, 37, and 45). There is sufficient evidence to list hexachlorophene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section  313(d)(2)(C) based on the available ecotoxicity information for this chemical, because the estimated and measured aquatic acute toxicity values for hexachlorophene are less than 100 ppb.",
