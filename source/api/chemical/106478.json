    "Federal Register": "43. p-Chloroaniline (CAS No. 000106-47-8) (CERCLA; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). In a 78-week study in which rats were fed p-chloroaniline, non-neoplastic proliferative lesions of the splenic capsule (focal fibrosis with subcapsular mesenchymal proliferation) were observed. The LOAEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day (the lowest dose tested) and the RfD derived from this data is 0.004 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing p-chloroaniline on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to section 313(d) (2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity data for this chemical.",
