    "Federal Register": "54. Crotonaldehyde (CAS No. 004170-30-3) (RCRA APP8) (Ref. 8). Crotonaldehyde has been tested for carcinogenicity in one animal study. When crotonaldehyde was administered to male F344 rats at 0, 42, or 421 mg/L for 113 weeks, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms (benign and malignant combined) in the low dose group. The lack of tumorigenic effects at the high-dose group is believed to be due to the hepatotoxicity observed in this group. At high dose, crotonaldehyde is cytotoxic; cells died before neoplasms are manifested. Crotonaldehyde and other alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyls are chemically reactive compounds which can readily react with cellular macromolecules such as DNA and proteins. Mutagenicity studies in a slightly modified preincubation Ames test have clearly shown that crotonaldehyde is mutagenic. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing crotonaldehyde on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity and mutagenicity data for this chemical.",
