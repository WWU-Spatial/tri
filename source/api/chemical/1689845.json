    "Federal Register": "26. Bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) (CAS No. 001689-84-5)(FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Developmental effects (hydrocephalus, microphthalmia, anophthalmia and severe defects in ossification of the skull) were observed in rabbits administered 60 mg/kg/day bromoxynil by gavage. The NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. Developmental toxicity (increases in all forms of supernumerary ribs) was also observed in rats at 5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day. Thematernal LOEL (based on body weight loss) was 30 mg/kg/day. Several other developmental studies indicate potential developmental toxicity of bromoxynil. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bromoxynil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
