    "Federal Register": "105. 2,4-Dithiobiuret (CAS No. 000541-53-7) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). In experimental animals, 2,4-dithiobiuret is a highly toxic substance that causes death through respiratory depression and respiratory failure. Rats receiving 1 mg/kg/day for 6 days suffered from delayed onset of neuromuscular depression. Rats given 2,4-dithiobiuret for 52 days showed signs of muscle weakness after a latency period of 3 to 4 days. The NOEL was determined to be 0.125 mg/kg/day. The LOEL was 0.25 mg/kg/day. The cause of the muscle weakness was depressed neuromuscular transmission. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-dithiobiuret on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical.",
