    "Federal Register": "130. Fomesafen (5-(2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)-N methylsulfonyl)-2-nitrobenzamide) (CAS No. 072178-02-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Decreased plasma cholesterol and triglycerides and increased liver weights (reversible at 7 days post-treatment) were observed at 50 mg/kg/day (only dose tested) when administered in the diet of rats for 4 weeks. In a 90-day rat study, dietary administration of 5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced alterations in lipid metabolism and increases in liver weight. The NOEL was 0.25 mg/kg/day. In a 26-week dog study, dietary administration of 25 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced alterations in lipid metabolism and liver changes (changes not defined). The NOEL was 1 mg/kg/day. Liver toxicity (increased liver masses, discolored hepatocytes, and pigmented Kupffer cells) was observed in a 2-year rat feeding study at 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. Metabolism studies have shown that fomesafen accumulates in the liver. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fomesafen on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data for this chemical.",
