    "Federal Register": "186. Paraquat dichloride (CAS No. 001910-42-5) (EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Paraquat can cause death in humans as a consequence of severe injury to the lungs, or as a result of kidney, liver, or heart failure. Following exposure, death may occur in 24 hours or less. The acute oral LD sub 50 values for paraquat are reported as 57, 120, 25, 50 and 35 mg/kg in the rat, mouse, dog, monkey, and cat, respectively. Chronic pneumonitis (the LOEL was 0.93 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.45 mg/kg/day) was reported in dogs fed diets containing paraquat dichloride for 52 weeks. These results are supported by the results of a 2-year feeding study in rats (the LOEL was 3.75 mg/kg/day based on nonneoplastic lung lesions; the NOEL was 1.25 mg/kg/day) and a 90-day feeding study in dogs (the LOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day based on increased lung weight, alveolitis, and alveolar collapse; the NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day).\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing paraquat dichloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity data for this chemical.",
