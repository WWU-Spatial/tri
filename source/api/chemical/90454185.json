    "Federal Register": "Chemicals; Toxic Chemical Release Reporting; Community Right-To-Know; Proposed Significant New Use Rule\r\n\r\nSUMMARY: EPA is partially granting a petition submitted by Governor Mario M.Cuomo of New York and the Natural Resources Defense Council to add 80 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) by proposing to add 68 chemicals and 2 chemical categories. All of  the chemicals and chemical categories contained in this petition appear on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) list of hazardous wastes at 40 CFR 261.33(f). The addition of these chemicals and chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals is based on their acute human health effects, carcinogenicity or other chronic human health effects, or their environmental effects. EPA believes that these chemicals and chemical categories meet the criteria for addition to the list of toxic substances as established in EPCRA section 313(d)(2). EPA is not proposing to add the remaining 12 chemicals addressed in this petition because the available data do not indicate that these chemicals meet the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2). Alternatively, EPA is proposing to add only those chemicals identified in this document that are produced in quantities greater than a certain manufacturing threshold.",
