    "Federal Register": "13. Bendiocarb (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxol-4-ol methylcarbamate) (CAS No. 022781-23-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Depressed blood cholinesterase levels were reported in numerous species. In a developmental toxicity study in rats, cholinergic signs were observed in maternal animals at 4 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The maternal NOEL was 1 mg/kg/day; no adverse effects were observed in fetuses. A LOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day for cholinesterase inhibition was reported in dogs in a 4-month dietary study. The NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. Decreases in cholinesterase activity were observed in female rats fed 20, 30, or 40 mg/kg/day for 28 days. No NOEL was established in this study. However, no details regarding clinical signs or histopathological changes in neural tissue were reported. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bendiocarb on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for bendiocarb include a mysid 96-hour EC sub 50 of 6.7 ppb and a daphnid 48-hour EC sub 50 of 29.2 ppb. Avian acute toxicity values include a mallard duck LD sub 50 of 3.1 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bendiocarb on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.",
