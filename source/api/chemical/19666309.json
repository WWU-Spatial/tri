    "Federal Register": "183. Oxydiazon (3-[2,4-Dichloro-5-(1-methylethoxy)phenyl]5- (1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2(3H)-one) (CAS No. 019666-30-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Rats given 40 mg/kg/day by gavage on days 6 to 15 of gestation exhibited increased fetal resorptions. The NOEL was 12 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nIncreased liver and kidney weight (associated with no pathology) and increased alkaline phosphatase activity were observed in rats fed 100 mg/kg/day (the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day) for 90 days. Increased levels of SGPT and alkaline phosphatase activities and increased liver weight (the LOEL was 5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day) were observed in a 2-year feeding study in rats. Effects noted at 150 mg/kg/day included liver pathology, hemolytic anemia, increased kidney weight, and pigment nephrosis. Based on the NOEL, an oral RfD of 0.005 mg/kg/day was derived. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing oxydiazon on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental, hepatic, and renal toxicity data for this chemical.",
