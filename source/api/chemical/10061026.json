    "Federal Register": "79. trans-1,3-Dichloropropene (CAS No. 010061-02-6) (CERCLA; CWA PPL) (Ref. 8). Clinical reports have documented the occurrence of histiocytic lymphoma in two firemen and acute myelomonocytic leukemia in a farmer exposed accidently to 1,3-dichloropropene. Information on the isomer or isomer mixture (i.e., trans/cis isomers) was not specified. The lymphoma and leukemia were refractory to treatment, and all three men died. There is evidence that 1,3-dichloropropene may cause cancer in rats and mice after oral exposure. In a 2-year gavage study, rats treated with 25 or 50 mg/kg/day 1,3-dichloropropene (53 percent cis isomer, 45 percent trans isomer, 1 percent epichlorhydrin) developed squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas of the forestomach. Male rats also developed neoplastic nodules of the liver. Female mice that received 50 or 100 mg/kg/day developed squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas of the forestomach, transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder, and an increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas. A statistically significant increase in bronchioalveolar adenomas was noted in male mice exposed to 60 ppm (272 mg/L) 1,3-dichloropropene vapors (50 percent cis isomer, 43 percent trans isomer). This benign lung tumor was not seen in female mice or in male or female rats. IARC assigned 1,3-dichloropropene to Group 2B, i.e., possibly carcinogenic in humans. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing trans-1,3-dichloropropene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for 1,3-dichloropropene (unspecified isomer).",
