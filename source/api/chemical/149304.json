    "Federal Register": "151. 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) (CAS No. 000149-30-4) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). The 21-day maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for daphnids range from 240 to 470 ppb. The 60-day MATC for rainbow trout range from 41 to 78 ppb. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that releases of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole will result in concentration levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse environmental effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2-mercaptobenzothiazole on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data and exposure data for this chemical.",
