    "Federal Register": "22. Bromacil lithium salt (2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, 5-bromo-6-methyl-3-(1-methylpropyl), lithium salt) (CAS No. 05340419-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Bromacil lithium salt will dissociate into bromacil, which is soluble in aqueous systems and lithium ion. Defects of the palate, eye, and external ear were reported in the offspring of rats administered 50 mg lithium chloride intraperitoneally on gestation days 1, 4, 7, and 9 followed by 20 mg/day until day 17. Cleft palates were also observed in mouse fetuses when mothers were gavaged with 300 to 465 mg/kg/day lithium carbonate on gestation day 6 to 15. An increase in Ebstein's anomaly was reported among offspring of women taking lithium; cardiovascular defects were found in 212 offspring exposed in utero to lithium therapy.\r\n\r\nIncreased thyroid activity was seen in male and female rats fed 5,000 ppm (250 mg/kg/day) bromacil for 90 days. In a 2-year dietary study, thyroid hyperplasia was seen in female rats fed 1,250 ppm (62.5 mg/kg/day). Thyroid follicular adenoma was observed in one female.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bromacil lithium salt on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental and thyroid toxicity data.",
