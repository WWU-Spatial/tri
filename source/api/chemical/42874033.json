    "Federal Register": "184. Oxyfluorfen (CAS No. 042874-03-3) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Oxyfluorfen is a phenoxyphenyl-type herbicide. Several chronic oral toxicity studies suggest that oxyfluorfen may be hepatotoxic. Hepatic effects (e.g. increased absolute liver weight, necrosis, regeneration, and hyperplastic nodules) were observed in mice fed diets containing greater than 3 mg/kg/day oxyfluorfen for 20 months (the NOEL was 0.3 mg/kg/day). Based on these findings, an oral RfD value of 0.003 mg/kg/day was derived. This study was supported by other chronic feeding studies that demonstrated increases in liver weight, alkaline phosphatase activity, and bile pigmented hepatocytes (the LOEL was 15 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day) in dogs, and minimal hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes (the LOEL was 40 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day) in rats. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing oxyfluorfen on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatotoxic effects of this chemical.\r\n\r\nThe estimated chronic MATC values for fish and daphnids are 9 ppb and 20 ppb oxyfluorfen, respectively. The estimated log K sub ow is 6.1. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing oxyfluorfen on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data and potential for bioaccumulation for this chemical.",
