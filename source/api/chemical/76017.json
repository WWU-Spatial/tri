    "Federal Register": "57. Pentachloroethane (CAS No. 00076-01-7). Pentachloroethane is reported to  induce headaches, dizziness, confusion, drowsiness, convulsion, coma, and respiratory arrest in humans. No exposure information was provided. Exposure to  pentachloroethane induced narcosis preceded by restlessness and excitement in dogs following repeated inhalation of 10 ml and CNS depression in cats following inhalation of 146 ppm (1.5 mg/L) 8 to 9 hours daily for 23 days. Pentachloroethane induced the behavioral effects of altered sleep in rats and dogs; the rats also exhibited ataxia. The LD 50 values associated with these effects are 920 mg/kg in rats following subcutaneous injection, and 500 mg/kg in dogs following oral exposure (Refs. 7, 37, and 46). Therefore, there may be sufficient evidence for listing pentachloroethane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant  to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurotoxicity data for this chemical.",
