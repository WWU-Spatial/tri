    "Federal Register": "161. 2-Methyllactonitrile (CAS No. 000075-86-5) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). 2-Methyllactonitrile belongs to a class of substances known as the cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrins are generally quite toxic because they can release hydrogen cyanide. An oral dose of 5 mg/rat (approximately 14 mg/kg) of 2-methyllactonitrile administered twice weekly for 3 to 8 months produced liver and kidney lesions. Inhalation of 10.2 mg/L twice weekly for 3 to 8 months (duration of each individual exposure not reported) produced kidney lesions, desquamation of the bronchial epithelium, and bronchial ulcerations. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2-methyllactonitrile on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxic effects to the liver, kidney, and bronchi caused by this chemical.",
