    "Federal Register": "182. Oxydemeton methyl (S-(2-(Ethylsulfinyl)ethyl) O,O-dimethyl ester phosphorothioic acid) (CAS No. 000301-12-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Two multigeneration reproduction studies indicate a variety of reproductive effects at 2.1 to 2.5 mg/kg/day. These effects include decreased litter size and viability, decreased weight of the testes and ovaries, and increased epididymal vacuolation. The NOELs were 0.38 and 0.5 mg/kg/day. A NOEL of 0.9 mg/kg/day was determined in a 5-day study in the rat. The LOEL for decreased fertility and epididymal sperm motility was 5 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nOxydemeton methyl can cause inhibition of brain, plasma, and red blood cell cholinesterase. In a 2-generation reproduction study, statistically significant inhibition of red blood cell and brain cholinesterase activity (the NOEL was less than 0.043 mg/kg/day) was observed in adult males and females of the F sup 0 and F sup 1 generations. In a 5-day feeding (dominant lethal plus) study, inhibition of plasma cholinesterase activity (the LOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.45 mg/kg/day) was observed. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing oxydemeton methyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available reproductive and neurological toxicity data for this chemical.",
