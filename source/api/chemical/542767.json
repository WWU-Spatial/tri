    "Federal Register": "48. 3-Chloropropionitrile (CAS No. 000542-76-7) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). 3-Chloropropionitrile is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes to release cyanide. The substance is readily absorbed both dermally and orally. The mouse oral LD sub 50 is 51.3 mg/kg.\r\n\r\nEPA's exposure analysis indicates that 3-chloropropionitrile concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3-chloropropionitrile on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
