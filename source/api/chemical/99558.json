    "Federal Register": "54. 5-Nitro-o-toluidine (CAS No. 00099-55-8). 5-Nitro-o-toluidine is classified as a Group C carcinogen by EPA; i.e., the compound is possibly carcinogenic to humans. It is classified as a Group 3 chemical by IARC, based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. In an NCI bioassay, hepatocarcinomas, hemangiomas, and hemangiosarcomas were observed in mice following dietary exposure. No carcinogenic effects were noted in rats when exposed to lower doses than those used in mice. In addition, two structural analogues of 5-nitro-o-toluidine, o-toluidine, and 2-methoxy-5-nitro-aniline, were carcinogenic in both rats and mice. 5-Nitro-o-toluidine is expected to be bioactivated and to exert its carcinogenicity via the same mechanism as these two aromatic compounds. 5-Nitro-o-toluidine also has been shown to be mutagenic in the Ames test (Refs. 34 and 37). Therefore, there may be sufficient evidence for listing 5-nitro-o-toluidine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA  section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical and on analogy to similar aromatic compounds.
