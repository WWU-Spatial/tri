    "Federal Register": "5. Aldicarb (CAS No. 000116-06-3) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Aquatic acute toxicity test data for aldicarb include a measured 96-hour LC sub 50 of 50 ppb for bluegill and a measured 48-hour LC sub 50 of 70 ppb for daphnid. In addition, the measured 48-hour EC sub 50 for daphnid is 51 ppb. Measured terrestrial acute toxicity data for wildlife include an oral LD sub 50 for female mallard ducks of 3.4 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) and an oral LD sub 50 for California quail of 2.58 mg/kg in males and 4.67 mg/kg in females. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing aldicarb on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
