    "Federal Register": "208. Potassium bromate (CAS No. 007758-01-2) (IARC) (Ref. 8). IARC has assigned potassium bromate to Group 2B, i.e., it is possibly carcinogenic to humans. Male and female rats orally exposed to 250 or 500 ppm (35 to 70 mg/kg/day) potassium bromate in drinking water for 110 weeks had an increased incidence of renal cell adenomas and adenocarcinomas and, in males, there was also an increased incidence of mesothelioma in the peritoneal cavity. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing potassium bromate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
