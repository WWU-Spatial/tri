    "Federal Register": "76. trans-1,4-Dichloro-2-butene (CAS No. 000110-57-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Mortality in two of six rats was observed following inhalational exposure to 62 ppm (0.34 mg/L) for 4 hours. An acute inhalation LC sub 50 in rats was 86 ppm (0.44 mg/L). EPA's exposure analysis indicates that trans-1,4-dichloro-2-butene concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing trans-1,4-dichloro-2-butene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
