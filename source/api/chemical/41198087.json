    "Federal Register": "212. Profenofos (O-(4-bromo-2-chlorophenyl)-O-ethyl-Spropyl phosphorothioate) (CAS No. 041198-08-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 6-month feeding study in dogs, inhibition of plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase activities were observed at 2 ppm (0.05 mg/kg/day). The NOEL was 0.2 ppm (0.005 mg/kg/day). Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.00005 mg/kg/day. Other studies (21, 28, and 90-day studies in rat, rabbit and dog) also demonstrate cholinesterase (plasma, red blood cell or brain) inhibition in rats and mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing profenofos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data.",
