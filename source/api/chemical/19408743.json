However, many of these compounds, especially those with chlorine or bromine substitution at the 2,3,7,8-positions, are generally recognized to exhibit toxicity and carcinogenicity similar to 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Indeed, carcinogenesis bioassays of a mixture of 1,2,3,6,7,8- and 1,2,3,7,8,9- hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin have shown that these compounds are carcinogenic, inducing liver tumors in both sexes of rats and mice.",
