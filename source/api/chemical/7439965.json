    "Federal Register": "2. Manganese and compounds. The central nervous system (CNS) effects of manganese compounds have been known for a long time. The disorder, manganism, has been described in workers in industries that typically involve exposure to manganese oxide dust or manganese fumes, including ore crushing and packing dust or manganese fumes, including ore crushing and packing mills, in ferroalloy production, use of manganese alloy in the steel industry, in dry cell battery manufacture, and in welding rod manufacture. Chronic manganese poisoning usually evolves through two stages, an initial maniacal state and a chronic stage characterized by parkinsonism, dystonia, and cerebellar ataxia. Regardless of the onset symptoms, once the chronic stage has developed, the neurologic dysfunction is irreversible. The full clinical picture of chronic manganese poisoning most often occurs at exposures to levels above 5 mg/m3 for periods of 2 to 3 years, but it has been reported to occur at lower levels or after only a few months. The spectrum of neurologic dysfunction observed in chronic manganese neurotoxicity effects in humans can be reproduced, in part, in different animal species, including rats, rabbits, and monkeys (characteristic CNS signs were produced in monkeys exposed to manganese dioxide).",
