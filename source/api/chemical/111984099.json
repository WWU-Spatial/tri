    "Federal Register": "88. 3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine hydrochloride (o-Dianisidine hydrochloride) (CAS No. 111984-09-9) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). IARC has classified 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine (o-dianisidine) as a Group 2B compound, i.e., this chemical is possibly carcinogenic. In an NTP carcinogenicity bioassay, increases in neoplasms of the skin, oral cavity, large intestine, liver, uterus and cervix were noted in rats administered this chemical in drinking water at dose levels of 6, 12, or 21 mg/kg/day in males and 7, 14, or 23 mg/kg/day in females. The hydrochloride salt of o-dianisidine is expected to be equally as toxic as the free base (o-dianisidine). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3,3'dimethoxybenzidine hydrochloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on its potential to cause cancer in humans.",
