    "Federal Register": "95. N,N-Dimethylformamide (CAS No. 000068-12-2) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). In humans, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) produced an increase in subjective symptoms suggestive of mild liver dysfunction in workers and changes in objective measurements of liver damage (serum enzymes and liver enlargement) via inhalation exposure, resulting in a LOAEL of 22 mg/m3 (adjusted LOAEL of 7.9 mg/m3)). Although there are several additional studies which are generally inadequate when considered individually, taken together, these studies demonstrate that DMF exposure is associated with hepatic toxicity in humans.Several animal inhalation studies further support the hepatotoxic effects of DMF. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing N,N-dimethylformamide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based upon the available hepatotoxicity data for this chemical.",
