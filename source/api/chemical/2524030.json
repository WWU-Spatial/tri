    "Federal Register": "93. Dimethyl chlorothiophosphate (CAS. No. 002524-03-0) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). In a dominant lethal study, male rats were administered dimethyl chlorothiophosphate by gavage for 5 consecutive days and mated to untreated females. The LOEL of 7.5 mg/kg/day was determined based on an increase in preimplantation losses and dead implants. No NOEL for dimethyl chlorothiophosphate was determined from this study. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dimethyl chlorothiophosphate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
