    "Federal Register": "147. Lithium carbonate (CAS No. 000554-13-2) (CAL) (Ref. 8). A major use of lithium carbonate is in the treatment of manic episodes of manic-depressive illness. Decreases in the number of implantations, number of live fetuses and fetal body weight, and increases in resorptions and various limb/skeletal anomalies were reported in the offspring of Wistar rats that received 100 mg/kg (the fetotoxic LOEL; the fetotoxic NOEL was 50 mg/kg) during gestation days 6 through 15. Offspring of mice that received 465 mg/kg/day during gestation days 6 through 15 had increased craniofacial abnormalities. Fetal death and reductions in litter size were also noted. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing lithium carbonate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
