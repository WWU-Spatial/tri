    "Federal Register": "267. 2,3,5-Trimethylphenyl methylcarbamate (CAS No. 002655-15-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Cholinesterase inhibition was reported in a series of studies for this carbamate pesticide. In dogs that received 2,000 ppm (50 mg/kg/day) 2,3,5-trimethylphenyl methylcarbamate in their diet for 14 days, there was inhibition of plasma and red blood cell cholinesterases and also weight loss. Brain cholinesterase was slightly decreased in rats in a 2-year feeding study at 200 ppm (10 mg/kg/day). At 800 ppm (40 mg/kg/day), there were fatty changes in the liver which disappeared after 7.5 months. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,3,5-trimethylphenyl methylcarbamate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical.",
