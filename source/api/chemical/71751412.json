    "Federal Register": "1. Abamectin (avermectin B1) (CAS No. 071751-41-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). This compound induces developmental toxicity in several species with the mouse being the most sensitive species. Increased retinal folds in weanlings, decreased viability and lactation indices, and decreased body weight were noted in a two-generation rat reproduction study. The lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL) was 0.4 milligram per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) and the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was 0.12 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived a reference dose (RfD) of 0.0004 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing abamectin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for abamectin include a bluegill 96-hour LC sub 50 of 9.6 parts per billion (ppb), a rainbow trout 96-hour LC sub 50 of 3.6 ppb, and a daphnid 48-hour LC sub 50 of 0.34 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing abamectin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.",
