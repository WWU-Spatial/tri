    "Federal Register": "48. 2-Methylpyridine (CAS No. 00109-06-8). In humans, 2-methylpyridine is reported to induce weight loss, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, ataxia, unconsciousness, facial flushing, skin rash, giddiness, headache, and increases  in heart and respiration rates. However, no information was provided as to the incidence of these effects or the exposure conditions. Two of six rats surviving a single oral dose of 950 mg/kg 2-methylpyridene showed signs of encephalomalacia (areas devoid of neuronal elements, neurons, and supportive cells, normally found in brain tissues). In another study in rats, exposure to 300 mg/kg/day of the chemical for 10 days decreased the number of cells of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal neurosecretory system. Doses (route unspecified) of 2-methylpyridene as low as 0.0025 mg/kg for 6 months induced functional and dystrophic changes in the cerebral cortex and morphological changes in neurons.  The highest dose (0.05 mg/kg) resulted in constant demyelination of nerve pathways in the brain. In mice, oral sublethal doses induced short periods of excitation followed by depression of the CNS and sleepiness (Refs. 12 and 37). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing 2-methylpyridine on EPCRAsection 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurotoxicity data for this chemical.",
