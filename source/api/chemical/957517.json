    "Federal Register": "99. Diphenamid (CAS No. 000957-51-7) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Diphenamid is a diphenylacetamide-type herbicide. In a 2-year study in dogs fed diphenamid, an increase in liver weight and an increase in portal macrophages and fibroblasts were seen at the LOEL of 10 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, an RfD of 0.03 mg/kg/day was derived. In a 2-year study in rats fed diphenamid, an increase in liver weight was seen at the LOEL of 30 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. Although, no histopathological changes were reported in these studies, biochemical changes accompanied by histo-pathological changes were observed in a 2-generation study in rat pups. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diphenamid on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatotoxicity data for this chemical.",
