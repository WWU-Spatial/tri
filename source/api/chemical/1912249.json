    "Federal Register": "12. Atrazine (6-chloro-N-ethyl-N'-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5,-triazine-2,4-diamine) (CAS No. 001912-24-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified atrazine as a Group 2B compound; i.e., the chemical is possibly carcinogenic to humans. Administration of atrazine to Sprague Dawley rats was associated with an increased incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas and adenocarcinomas in female rats. A hormonal mechanism may be involved in the induction of mammary tumors by atrazine. Therefore there is sufficient evidence for listing atrazine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
