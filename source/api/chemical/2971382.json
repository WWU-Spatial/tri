    "Federal Register": "66. 2,4-D chlorocrotyl ester (CAS No. 002971-38-2) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D chlorocrotyl ester is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type herbicide. In mammals, the chlorocrotyl ester of 2,4-D is hydrolyzed to yield the free acid, 2,4-D. Therefore, the toxicity of 2,4-D chlorocrotyl ester is expected to be similar to that of 2,4-D, in which the kidney, liver and nervous system are the primary targets of injury. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D chlorocrotyl ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the known toxic effects of its metabolite 2,4-D.",
