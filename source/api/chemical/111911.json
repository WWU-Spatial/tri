    "Federal Register": "9. Bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane (CAS No. 00111-91-1). Inhalation of 120 ppm (0.85 milligram per liter (mg/L)) of bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane for 4 hours resulted in deaths of six of six rats. It has a high degree of toxicity in the rat orally and in the guinea pig by skin contact (Ref. 37). However, the dose levels were not reported. Therefore, there may be sufficient evidence for listing bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity data for this chemical.
