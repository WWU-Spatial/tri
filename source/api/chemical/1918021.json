    "ChemName": "PICLORAM",
    "Federal Register": "204. Picloram (CAS No. 001918-02-1) (FIFRA AI; SDWA) (Ref. 8). Animal studies in dogs, rats, or mice for various durations (2 weeks to 2 years) have indicated the liver as the primary target of picloram toxicity. In a 6-month feeding study in beagle dogs, a LOAEL of 35 mg/kg/day and a NOAEL of 7 mg/kg/day were determined for increased liver weights (relative and absolute). At a higher dose (175 mg/kg/day), there were increases in serum alkaline phosphatase concomitant with the increases in liver weight. Other toxic effects in the higher dosed animals included reduced food consumption and body weight. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.07 mg/kg/day for this chemical based on the findings of this study. Hepatotoxicity has also been reported in a 2-year rat feeding study. The LOAEL was 60 mg/kg/day based on changes in liver histopathology. The NOAEL was 20 mg/kg/day. Hepatotoxicity was also observed in a 90-day rat feeding study. The LOAEL was 150 mg/kg/day based on changes in liver histopathology, necrosis, and bile duct proliferation. The NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day. Increased liver weights were also reported in mice following dietary exposure to picloram for 13 weeks. The LOAEL was 1,000 mg/kg/day. Liver swelling was reported in rats administered picloram in feed for 13 weeks. The LOAEL was 150 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing picloram on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatotoxicity data for this chemical.",
