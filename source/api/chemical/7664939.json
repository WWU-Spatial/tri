    "Federal Register": "Limited data on long-term human exposure to sulfuric acid with respect to occupational settings are available. Recent studies suggest that sulfuric acid aerosols at levels as low as 0.02 to 0.04 mg/m sup 3 may cause significant effects on lung function in humans. Effects noted include increased risk of chronic bronchitis in smokers and reduced tracheobronchial clearance rate. Other studies suggest that sulfuric acid at concentrations as low as 0.04 mg/m sup 3 may act synergistically with copollutants such as ozone, NO sub 2, and metal particulates in causing decreased pulmonary diffusing capacity and bronchial hypersensitivity. These effects are presumably attributable to the acidic and oxidative properties of sulfuric acid, and are therefore pH and concentration dependent. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sulfur dioxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for sulfuric acid, the hydrolysis product of sulfur dioxide.",
