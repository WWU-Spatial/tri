    "Federal Register": "113. Ethoprop (phosphorodithioic acid O-ethyl S,S-dipropyl ester) (CAS No. 013194-48-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Ethoprop is acutely toxic to animals. The acute oral LD sub 50 in rats is 5.62 mg/kg/day. Clinical signs of toxicity observed in animals at this dose level included depression, salivation, inactivity, convulsions and prostration. Similar signs were reported at the 4-hour inhalation LC sub 50 of 0.12 mg/L in rats. In a 2-year rat chronic feeding study, plasma, red blood cell, and brain cholinesterase inhibition were observed in both sexes at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.05 mg/kg/day. Similar results were reported in a chronic dietary study in mice at 0.1 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.01 mg/kg/day. The two chronic studies together with the results of acute studies indicate the potential neurotoxicity of ethoprop. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ethoprop on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for ethoprop include a mysid 96-hour LC sub 50 of 7.5 ppb, a shrimp 96-hour LC sub 50 of 13 ppb, and a daphnid 48-hour EC sub 50 of 93 ppb. Avian acute and dietary toxicity data include a ring-necked pheasant 14-day LD sub 50 of 4.2 mg/kg and a mallard duck 14-day LD sub 50 of 12.6 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ethoprop on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
