    "Federal Register": "190. Perchloromethyl mercaptan (CAS No. 000594-42-3) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). The rat oral LD sub 50 and 4-hour rat inhalation LC sub 50 values for perchloromethyl mercaptan are 8.26 mg/kg and 0.26 mg/L, respectively. The 2-hour mouse inhalation LC sub 50 value is reported to be 0.296 mg/L. In an eye irritation test, 50 micrograms ( mu g) (0.13 mg/kg/day) placed in a rabbit's eye for 24 hours produced a severe reaction. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that perchloromethyl mercaptan concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing perchloromethyl mercaptan on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
