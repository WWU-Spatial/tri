    "Federal Register": "115. Famphur (CAS No. 000052-85-7) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Famphur is a thiophosphate-type cholinesterase inhibitor. In a 90-day feeding study, rats given diets supplemented with famphur showed decreased plasma and brain cholinesterase activity at 1.25 mg/kg/day, and decreased whole blood cholinesterase activity at 0.15 mg/kg/day. A bull was treated with famphur for 43 days before signs of neurotoxicity appeared. The symptoms, including paresis of all four limbs, were attributed to focal cervical or diffuse spinal cord lesions. Calves receiving 60.75 mg/kg showed marked inhibition of whole blood cholinesterase. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing famphur on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity known for this chemical.\r\n\r\nMeasured terrestrial wildlife acute toxicity data for famphur indicate that the oral LD sub 50 values for the redwinged blackbird and the starling are 1.78 mg/kg and 4.22 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, the measured oral LD sub 50 for mallard ducks is 3.45 mg/kg (based on 35 percent active ingredient). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing famphur on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
