    "ChemName": "3,3'-DIMETHYLBENZIDINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE (O-TOLIDINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE)",
    "Federal Register": "91. 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (o-Tolidine dihydrochloride) (CAS No. 000612-82-8) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). In a bioassay conducted by NTP, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride was found to be carcinogenic in both mice and rats. Male and female mice exposed to concentrations of 5 to 140 ppm (0.95 to 26.6 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 112 weeks developed lung alveolar cell adenoma and adenocarcinoma. Male and female F344 rats exposed to concentrations of 30 to 150 ppm (4.2 to 21 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 60 to 61 weeks developed tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung and oral cavity. Tumors in the skin, Zymbal's gland, preputial gland in males, clitoral gland and mammary gland in females, and leukemia in females were also noted in this study. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on its potential to cause cancer in humans.",
