    "Federal Register": "194. 1,2-Phenylenediamine (CAS No. 000095-54-5) (RCRA APP8) (Ref. 8). EPA has classified 1,2-phenylenediamine as a Group B2 compound, i.e., a probable human carcinogen. 1,2-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride appeared to be carcinogenic in both rats and mice, as evidenced by an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in both species. A significantly increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was observed in high dose group male rats and mice, and female mice of both treated groups. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 1,2-phenylenediamine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for 1,2-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride.",
