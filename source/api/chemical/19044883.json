    "Federal Register": "181. Oryzalin (4-(Dipropylamino)-3,5-dinitrobenzene sulfonamide) (CAS No. 019044-88-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Reduced hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, decreased red blood cell count, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and alkaline phosphatase and SGPT, anemia, hepatic changes, splenic hematopoiesis and hyperplastic bone marrow were observed in dogs fed 56.25 mg/kg/day (the NOEL was 18.75 mg/kg/day) for 3 months. Increases in serum cholesterol levels, alkaline phosphatase activity, and relative liver and kidney weights and decreases in alanine transaminase (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs fed oryzalin for 1-year. Decreased red blood cell count and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels (LOEL was 45 mg/kg/day; NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day) were noted in a 1-year feeding study in rats. In a 2-year feeding study in rats, decreased red blood cell count and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, and increased BUN and liver and kidney weights (the LOEL was 45 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day) were observed. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing oryzalin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and hematological toxicity data for this chemical.",
