    "Federal Register": "255. Tribenuron methyl (2-(((((4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-methylamino)carbonyl)amino) sulfonyl)-, methyl ester) (CAS No. 101200-48-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 1-year feeding study in dogs, elevated serum bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels and increased urinary volume were reported in males receiving 8.16 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL for males was 0.79 mg/kg/day. The LOEL for females was 52.02 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested) and was based on increased serum creatinine and transient increases in AST, globulin, and serum bilirubin. These females had an 18.2 percent decrease in body weight gain. The NOEL for females was 8.18 mg/kg/day. The highest dose in males (51.46 mg/kg/day) caused increases in serum creatinine and a 20 percent decrease in body weight gain. The oral RfD, derived from the NOEL for males, was 0.008 mg/kg/day. In a 90-day feeding study, decreased absolute and relative liver and kidney weights, serum glucose, globulin and cholesterol levels were observed in rats at 87.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing tribenuron methyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and renal toxicity data for this chemical.",
