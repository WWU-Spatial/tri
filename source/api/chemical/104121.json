    "Federal Register": "46. p-Chlorophenyl isocyanate (CAS No. 000104-12-1) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). p-Chlorophenyl isocyanate is very lethal following inhalation. The 4-hour mouse inhalation LC sub 50 value is 0.053 mg/L. In addition, isocyanates as a class are generally severe skin, eye, and respiratory irritants following acute exposure.\r\n\r\nEPA's exposure analysis indicates that p-chlorophenyl isocyanate concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing p-chlorophenyl isocyanate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
