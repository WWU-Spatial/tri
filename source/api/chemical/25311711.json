In a 108-week feeding study in mice, inhibition of brain cholinesterase (the LOEL was 100 ppm or 13 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 10 ppm or 1.3 mg/kg/day) and plasma cholinesterase (the LOEL was 10 ppm or 1.3 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.13 mg/kg/day) was observed. Inhibition of red blood cell cholinesterase (the LOEL was 10 ppm or 0.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 1 ppm or 0.05 mg/kg/day) was seen in a 2-year feeding study in rats. Other studies (14- and 90-day feeding studies in dogs, 30- and 90-day studies in rats, and a 3-week inhalation study in rats) also demonstrate cholinesterase (plasma, red blood cell or brain) inhibition in rats and dogs. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isophenphos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for isofenphos include a daphnid 48-hour EC sub 50 of 1.6 ppb and a mysid 96-hour EC sub 50 of 1.7 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isofenphos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.",
