    "Federal Register": "226. Sodium dicamba (3,6-Dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid, sodium salt) (CAS No. 001982-69-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). No toxicity data are available for sodium dicamba. However, data are available on dicamba as discussed below. In solution, sodium dicamba will dissociate into sodium ion and the dicamba anion. Decreased fetal body weights and increased postimplantation loss were observed in the offspring of rabbits receiving 10 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 18 of gestation. The LOEL was 10 mg/kg/day and NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD value of 0.03 mg/kg/day. In a separate study, disorders of oxidative phosphorylation and focal necrosis in the heart were observed in newborn rats following transplacental exposure to dicamba. In a developmental toxicity study, an increase in skeletal malformations was seen in the offspring of rats orally administered 64 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 19 of gestation. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium dicamba on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for dicamba.",
