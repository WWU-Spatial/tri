    "Federal Register": "150. Mecoprop (CAS No. 000093-65-2) (IARC) (Ref. 8). Mecoprop is a mono-chloro, mono-methylphenoxy isopropanoic acid type herbicide. IARC has assigned mecoprop to Group 2B, i.e., it is possibly carcinogenic to humans.\r\n\r\nIn several animal studies, changes in liver or kidney weights were the most sensitive indicators of mecoprop toxicity. In a 90-day rat feeding study, the LOAEL was 9 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day. At 26 mg/kg/day, the changes in organ weights were accompanied by decreased glucose levels in males and increased creatinine levels in females. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.001 mg/kg/day from this study.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing mecoprop on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatic and renal toxicity data for this chemical.",
