    "ChemName": "PRONAMIDE",
    "Federal Register": "59. Pronamide (CAS No. 23950-58-5). There are several studies that suggest that pronamide induces liver tumors in mice following oral exposure to doses as  low as 500 ppm (Refs. 9, 10, 29, and 37). Therefore, there may be sufficient evidence for listing pronamide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical. The  use of pronamide as a pesticide is restricted under FIFRA (Refs. 9, 10, and 30). Additional toxicity data may be available on EPA's One-Liner data base; however, it is CBI under FIFRA.  ",
