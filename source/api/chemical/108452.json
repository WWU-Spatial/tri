Increased absolute and relative liver weights and degenerative liver lesions (the LOEL was 18 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 6.0 mg/kg/day) were noted in a 90-day oral study in rats exposed to 1,3-phenylenediamine. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 1,3-phenylenediamine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatotoxicity data for this chemical.",
