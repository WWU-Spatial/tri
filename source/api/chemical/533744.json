    "Federal Register": "61. Dazomet (tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-2H-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione) (CAS No. 000533-74-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Animals fed dazomet at a dietary dose of 40 ppm for 2 years showed focal necrosis and fatty metamorphosis of the liver. Rats fed 30.3 mg/kg/day experienced decreased weight gain and changes in liver weight. Renal focal tubular necrosis was seen in rats fed 10 ppm (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dazomet on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and renal toxicity data for this chemical.",
