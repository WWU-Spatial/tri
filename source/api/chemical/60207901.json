    "Federal Register": "219. Propiconazole (1-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]- methyl-1H-1,2,4,-triazole) (CAS No. 060207-90-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 2-generation rat reproduction study, dietary administration of 25 mg/kg/day produced an increased incidence of hepatic clear cell change in parental animals and administration of 125 mg/kg/day produced an increased incidence of hepatic lesions in offspring. The parental NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day and the developmental NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. In a 2-year mouse study, dietary administration of 65 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced increased liver lesions and liver weight in males, whereas, administration of 325 mg/kg/day produced increased liver tumors, increased SGPT and SGOT levels, increased liver weight, hepatocyte enlargement, and vacuolation and fat deposition in the liver of both sexes. The NOEL was 13 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nIn a 3-month dog dietary study, lymphoid follicles were observed in the mucous membranes of the pyloric part of the stomach at 6.25 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 1.25 mg/kg/day. In a 1-year dog study, dietary administration of 6.25 mg/kg/day produced mild gastric mucosal irritation. The NOEL was 1.25 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL of the study, an oral RfD of 0.013 mg/kg/day was derived.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propiconazole on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicity data for this chemical.",
