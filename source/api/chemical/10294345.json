    "ChemName": "BORON TRICHLORIDE",
    "Federal Register": "19. Boron trichloride (CAS No. 010294-34-5) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Boron trichloride is corrosive to the skin and mucosal tissue due to its rapid hydrolysis to hydrochloric acid and boric acid, the former acid being the corrosive species. Single, relatively large doses of boron administered through any route affects the central nervous system causing depressed circulation, diarrhea, vomiting, shock, and coma. The kidneys are the most severely affected organ. Symptoms of acute irritation of the upper airways were observed in humans at exposure levels of greater than or equal to 0.004 mg/L. Inhalation of 0.48 mg/L of boron trichloride proved fatal to certain laboratory animals.\r\n\r\nInhalation of 0.096 mg/L of boron trichloride for 7 hours produced adverse effects on the respiratory tract, and weight loss.\r\n\r\nEPA's exposure analysis indicates that boron trichloride concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing boron trichloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
