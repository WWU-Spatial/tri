    "Federal Register": "123. Ferbam (tris(dimethylcarbamodithioato-S,S')iron) (CAS No. 014484-64-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In an 80-week feeding study in rats, females fed 96 mg/kg/day had ataxia that progressed to hind limb paralysis. The NOEL was not determined. Symptoms of neurotoxicity reported in mice following acute oral exposure included somnolence, excitement and ataxia, although the doses at which these signs occurred were much higher (the LD sub 50 in this study was 3,400 mg/kg). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ferbam on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data.\r\n\r\nAquatic acute toxicity values for ferbam include a daphnid 48-hour LC sub 50 of 90 ppb, a 96-hour LC sub 50 of 52 ppb for the eastern oyster, and a guppy 96-hour LC sub 50 of 90 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ferbam on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
