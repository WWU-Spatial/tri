    "Federal Register": "27. Bromoxynil octanoate (octanoic acid, 2,6-dibromo-4-cyanophenyl ester) (CAS No. 001689-99-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Bromoxynil octanoate hydrolyzes to yield bromoxynil and octanol. In a dermal developmental toxicity study, bromoxynil octanoate was developmentally toxic to rat fetuses (increased incidences of supernumerary ribs) at 15 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. The maternal LOEL for decreased body weight gain was 20 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day. Developmental effects (hydrocephalus, microphthalmia, anophthalmia and severe defects in ossification of the skull) were observed in rabbits administered 60 mg/kg/day bromoxynil by gavage. The NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. Developmental toxicity (increases in all forms of supernumerary ribs) was also observed in rats at 5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day. The maternal LOEL (based on body weight loss) was 30 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bromoxynil octanoate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for bromoxynil and bromoxynil octanoate.",
