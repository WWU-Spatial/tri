    "Federal Register": "101. Dipotassium endothall (7-oxabicyclo(2.2.1)heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, dipotassium salt) (CAS No. 002164-07-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 2-year dog feeding study, increased absolute and relative weight of the stomach and small intestine was observed at 6 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day. An oral RfD of 0.02 mg/kg/day was derived based on the NOEL. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dipossium endothall on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for this chemical.",
