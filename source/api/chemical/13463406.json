    "ChemName": "IRON PENTACARBONYL",
    "Federal Register": "140. Iron pentacarbonyl (CAS No. 013463-40-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Humans exposed to high concentrations of iron pentacarbonyl immediately experience headache and dizziness. These effects are followed 12 to 36 hours after exposure by symptoms such as fever, cyanosis, cough, and shortness of breath. In humans, iron pentacarbonyl has also been known to cause adverse effects on the respiratory and central nervous system, liver, and kidney. The rat oral LD sub 50 is 25 mg/kg and the rat inhalation LC sub 50 value is 0.044 mg/L. The 4-hour inhalation LC sub 100 in mice is 0.007 mg/L. The rabbit oral LD sub 50 is 12 mg/kg. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that iron pentacarbonyl concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing iron pentacarbonyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
