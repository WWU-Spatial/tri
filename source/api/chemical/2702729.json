    "Federal Register": "112. 2,4-D sodium salt (CAS No. 002702-72-9) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D sodium salt is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type herbicide. In mammals, the sodium salt is expected to hydrolyze to yield the free acid, 2,4-D. Therefore, the toxicity of 2,4-D sodium salt is expected to be similar to that of 2,4-D, in which the kidney, liver, and nervous system are the primary targets of injury. 2,4-D is presently included in the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D sodium salt ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the systemic toxicity data for this chemical.",
