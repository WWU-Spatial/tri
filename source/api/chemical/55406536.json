    "Federal Register": "138. 3-Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate (CAS No. 055406-53-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 90-day rat study, oral administration of 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced increased liver-to-body-weight ratios. The NOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. In a 2-year rat study, dietary administration of 40 and 80 mg/kg/day produced significant non-neoplastic pathological changes in the stomach. No NOEL was established; the LOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. Based on this study, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.07 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3-iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for this chemical.",
