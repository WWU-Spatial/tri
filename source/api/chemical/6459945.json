    "Federal Register": "31. C.I. Acid Red 114 (CAS No. 006459-94-5) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). In a 2-year bioassay conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) in which F344 rats were exposed to C.I. Acid Red 114 via drinking water, hepatocellular carcinomas of the liver, tumors of the skin, and adenomas or carcinomas in the Zymbal's gland of both sexes were observed. In the same study, female rats also had increased incidences of adenoma or carcinoma in the clitoral gland, and squamous cell papilloma or carcinoma in the oral cavity. The exposure concentrations in this study ranged from 70 to 300 ppm (9.8 to 42 mg/kg/day) for males and from 150 to 600 ppm (21 to 84 mg/kg/day) for females. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing C.I. Acid Red 114 on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
