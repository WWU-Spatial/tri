    "Federal Register": "220. Quizalofop-ethyl (2-[4-[(6-chloro-2-quinoxalinyl) oxy]phenoxy] propanoic acid ethyl ester) (CAS No. 076578-14-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 3-month rat study, dietary administration of 6.4 mg/kg/day produced changes in liver weight and liver lesions. The NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day. In a 6-month dietary dog study, 10 mg/kg/day produced testicular atrophy in males. The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. Liver cell enlargement was observed at 3.7 mg/kg/day in males and 4.6 mg/kg/day in females (LOELs) in a 2-year rat dietary study. The NOELs for males and females were 0.9 mg/kg/day and 1.1 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on the study, an oral RfD of 0.009 mg/kg/day was derived. Increased liver weights were observed in pregnant rats in a teratology study. The maternal LOEL was 100 mg/kg/day and the NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. No teratogenic NOEL could be established. In a 2-generation rat reproduction study, increased liver weights and increased incidence of eosinophilic changes in the liver were observed in the offspring at 5 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 1.25 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing quizalofop-ethyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available reproductive and hepatic toxicity data for this chemical.",
