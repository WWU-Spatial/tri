    "Federal Register": "59. Cyhalothrin (3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid cyano(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl ester) (CAS No. 068085-85-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Cyhalothrin administered orally (in capsules) to dogs at 10 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks produced occasional disturbances of the nervous system (unsteadiness and/or muscular trembling). The NOEL for these effects was not defined. In a 1-year dog study, ataxia, muscle tremors, and convulsions were observed following oral administration at 3.5 mg/kg/day. Abnormal gait and convulsions were observed at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The LOEL of the study was 0.5 mg/kg/day and the NOEL was 0.1 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing cyhalothrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data.",
