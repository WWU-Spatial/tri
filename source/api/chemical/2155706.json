Mean fetal weight and maternal body weight gain were decreased at 18 mg/kg/day. Fetal resorptions were also significantly increased. The fetotoxic NOEL for this study was 9 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing tributyltin methacrylate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
