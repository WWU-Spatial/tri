    "Federal Register": "35. Carbofuran (CAS No. 001563-66-2) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Aquatic acute toxicity test data for carbofuran include a measured 96-hour LC sub 50 for bluegill of 80 ppb. In addition, the measured 48-hour EC sub 50 for daphnids is 35 ppb. Measured terrestrial acute toxicity data for wildlife include an oral LD sub 50 for mallard ducks of 0.397 mg/kg for females and 0.480 mg/kg for males and an oral LD sub 50 for female ring-necked pheasants of 4.15 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing carbofuran on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
