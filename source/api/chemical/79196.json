    "Federal Register": "252. Thiosemicarbazide (CAS No. 000079-19-6) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). The oral LD sub 50s for thiosemicarbazide in rats and dogs are 9.16 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. The LDLo in the mouse is 94 mg/kg. Cats orally administered thiosemicarbazide experienced convulsions, salivation, and vomiting; the LD sub 50 was 20 mg/kg. Intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 mg/kg of thiosemicarbazide produced restlessness, running fits, and convulsions in rabbits. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that thiosemicarbazide concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing thiosemicarbazide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical.",
