    "Federal Register": "119. Fenoxycarb (2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethyl]carbamic acid ethyl ester) (CAS No. 072490-01-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Liver changes (including fatty changes, glycogen depletion, hepatocyte hypertrophy and multinucleated hepatocytes) were reported in mice (the LOEL was 80 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was not determined) and rats (the LOEL was 300 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 100 mg/kg/day) following 3-month dietary exposures. Dose-related changes in the liver of male rats, including increased relative liver weight, focal necrosis, centrilobular hypertrophy and pigmented histiocytes, were reported after the first year of a 2-year oncogenicity study. The LOEL for these effects was 600 ppm (30 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was 200 ppm (10 mg/kg/day). Male and female rats exposed to a higher dose (1,800 ppm or 90 mg/kg/day) in this study had increased alkaline phosphatase and reduced platelets and white blood cells, and fibrosis was present in the hepatic lesions in the males.\r\n\r\nIn a reproduction study in rats, delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening were reported at 10 mg/kg/day.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fenoxycarb on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
