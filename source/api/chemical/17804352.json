    "Federal Register": "15. Benomyl (CAS No. 017804-35-2) (CAL; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). In a three-generation study in rats, a dietary level of 25 mg/kg/day of benomyl resulted in decreased weanling weights. The no-effect level was 5 mg/kg/day. Microphthalmia (the LOEL was 62.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day) was reported in a rat developmental toxicity study. Decreased fetal weight (the LOEL was 62.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day) was observed in another rat developmental toxicity study. The developmental effects were observed at doses that were not toxic to the maternal animal. Anomalies consisting of supra occipital scars, subnormal vertebral centrum, supernumary ribs, and cleft palate were reported in an oral developmental toxicity study in mice (the LOEL was 100 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 50 mg/kg/day). An increase in the incidence of anomalies including encephalocele, hydrocephalus, microphthalmia, and anophthalmia was noted following administration of benomyl to rats by intubation during the first 20 days of pregnancy at doses of 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg. The developmental effects were always associated with death and were considered to be the cause of death. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing benomyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for this chemical.",
