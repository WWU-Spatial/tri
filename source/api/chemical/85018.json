    "Federal Register": "192. Phenanthrene (CAS No. 000085-01-8) (CERCLA; CWA PP) (Ref. 8). Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for phenanthrene include a 48-hour LC sub 50 of 700 ppb for daphnids. The measured 28-day LC sub 50 for rainbow trout is 40 ppb, and teratogenetic effects were noted. The measured bioconcentration factor (BCF) values include a fathead minnow 28-day BCF of 5,100 and a daphnid 24-hour BCF of 1,165. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing phenanthrene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical and its potential to bioaccumulate.",
