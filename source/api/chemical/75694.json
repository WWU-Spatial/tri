    "Federal Register": "Effective July 8, 1990, the seven CFCs and halons which are the subject of this petition have been added to the section 313 list.  This addition has occurred pursuant to the section 313(e)(2), which stipulates that in the case of a petition submitted by a State Governor to add a chemical, the chemical will be added to the list within 180 days after receipt of the petition unless EPA denies the petition or initiates rulemaking to add the chemical within that time.\r\n\r\nEPA's concerns for these chemicals do not focus on direct toxicity, but rather on the depleting effect these chemicals have on stratospheric ozone and the increase in penetration of UV-B radiation which will result.  EPA has already conducted extensive analyses of available data on these chemicals in connection with the development of a rule limiting production and consumption of these chemicals in accordance with the Montreal Protocol.  Based on the supporting documents for that rules, EPA believes that releases of these chemicals will lead to stratospheric ozone depletion resulting in increased penetration of UV-B radiation.  Because this increased UV-B radiation can be reasonably anticipated to lead to cancer and other chronic human health effects and significant adverse environmental effect, EPA believes that these chemicals meet the statutory criteria for listing found in section 313(d)(2)(B) and (C) of EPCRA.",
