    "Federal Register": "23. Bromine (CAS No. 007726-95-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Rats fed bromine at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day for 6 months experienced changes in their reflexes and blood indexes. Rats, mice, and rabbits inhaling 0.001 mg/kg/day for 4 months developed functional abnormalities of the respiratory, nervous, and endocrine systems. Data on the acute and chronic effects of bromine in humans are limited. Bromine is very corrosive to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes in either the liquid or vapor form. A concentration of 10 ppm of bromine in air is intolerable in humans, and can cause severe irritation of the upper respiratory tract. Other clinical symptoms include neurologic, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal effects. The maximum concentration allowable in humans for a 0.5 to 1-hour exposure to bromine is 4 ppm. Bromine can cause lacrimation at concentrations less than 1 ppm. Chronic exposure to bromine (estimated concentration at 0.6 ppm) can result in eye irritation, upper respiratory irritation, coughing, and headache. Neurological symptoms have also been reported following chronic exposure to bromine.\r\n\r\nEPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bromine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for this chemical.",
