    "Federal Register": "7. Allylamine (CAS No. 000107-11-9) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Repeated inhalation exposure to 5 ppm (0.011 mg/L) allylamine for 50 exposures of 7 hours caused liver and renal damage and myocarditis in rats. Congestion of the liver and kidney was observed in rats, rabbits, and dogs exposed to 5 or 20 ppm (0.011 or 0.044 milligram per liter (mg/L)) allylamine for 8 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 1-year. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing allylamine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity data for this chemical.",
