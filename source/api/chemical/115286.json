Based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals IARC classified chlorendic acid as a Group 2B compound; i.e., it is possibly carcinogenic in humans. In an NTP bioassay, there was clear evidence of liver carcinogenicity in both rats and mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chlorendic acid on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
