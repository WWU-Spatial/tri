    "ChemName": "TRYPAN BLUE",
    "Federal Register": "68. Trypan blue (CAS No. 00072-57-1). Trypan blue is classified as a Group B2 carcinogen by EPA; i.e., it is probably carcinogenic to humans, based on sufficient evidence in animals and no evidence in humans. The compound is classified as a Group 2B carcinogen by IARC; i.e., the compound is possibly carcinogenic to humans. Following subcutaneous injection in rats, trypan blue induced tumors of the reticuloendothelial system, hepatic lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, thymus, thymic lymph nodes, nonabdominal lymph nodes, and kidney (Refs. 37 and 46). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence for listing trypan blue on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)  based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
