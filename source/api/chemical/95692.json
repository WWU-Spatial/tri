    "Federal Register": "49. p-Chloro-o-toluidine (CAS No. 000095-69-2) (IARC; NTP) (Ref. 8). p-Chloro-o-toluidine is classified as a Group B2 carcinogen by EPA; i.e., the compound is a probable human carcinogen. It is classified as a Group 2B carcinogen by IARC; i.e., a possible human carcinogen. Epidemiology studies are inadequate in evaluating the carcinogenic potential of 4-chloro-o-toluidine hydrochloride in humans. In a long-term feeding study by NCI, p-chloro-o-toluidine hydrochloride induced hemangiomas, hemangiosarcomas, and vascular tumors in mice. An increase in the incidence of pituitary chromophobe adenomas was observed in female rats following dietary administration. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing p-chloro-o-toluidine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical.",
