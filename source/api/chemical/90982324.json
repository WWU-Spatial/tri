    "Federal Register": "40. Chlorimuron ethyl (ethyl-2-[[[(4-chloro-6-methoxyprimidin-2-yl)-carbonyl]-amino]sulfonyl]benzoate) (CAS No. 090982-32-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 1-year dog study, dietary administration of 37.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced an increase in white blood cells in both sexes, a decrease in red blood cells, hematocrit, and hemoglobin in females, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase in males. The NOEL was 6.25 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, an oral RfD of 0.02 mg/kg/day was derived. This study was given a high confidence rating. In a 2-year rat feeding study, changes in hematology parameters were observed at the LOEL of 125 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day. In an 18-month mouse feeding study, centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed at 90 days at 187.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 18.75 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chlorimuron ethyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological toxicity data.",
