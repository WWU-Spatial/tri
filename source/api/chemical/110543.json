    "Federal Register": "133. n-Hexane (CAS No. 000110-54-3) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). In an epidemiology study, no neurological abnormalities were noted in workers. However, neurophysiological tests showed that the mean motor nerve conduction velocities of the exposed group was significantly decreased over the values for the control group. Also, the residual latency of motor nerve conduction of the posterior tibial nerve in the exposed group was significantly slowed when compared with the nonexposed group. A LOAEL of 204 mg/m sup 3 (58 ppm, LOAEL(ADJ) of 73 mg/m3) was established for these electrophysiological alterations in humans. The alterations observed are consistent with n-hexane-induced peripheral neuropathy observed in other studies in humans and in animals. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing n-hexane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based upon the available neurotoxicity data for this chemical.",
